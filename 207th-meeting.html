  <p><strong>III. APPROVAL OF MINUTES FROM PREVIOUS MEETING </strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Dombroski, Executive Secretary, NADCRC, also welcomed the Council members, guests, and virtual participants. She invited the Council to consider
    and approve the minutes of the May 20, 2014, Council meeting. The Council unanimously approved the minutes. </p>
  <p><strong>IV. REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, NIDCR </strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Somerman highlighted two key changes among NIDCR&#39;s senior staff, recent congressional activities, the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the NIH Common Fund, and
    the new NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy. She invited Council&#39;s questions on her full, written Director&#39;s Report to Council: September 2014, which was
    provided to the Council members and is available on the <a href="/Pages/default.aspx">NIDCR website</a>. </p>
  <p> <strong>NIDCR Senior Staff </strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Somerman announced that, following a nationwide search, Dr. Lillian Shum has been appointed Director, Division of Extramural Research (DER). Dr.
    Shum has been serving as acting director of DER since January 2014. She joined the NIDCR in 1985, first serving in the DIR and then serving as the Chief
    of DER&#39;s Integrative Biology and Infectious Diseases Branch. </p>
  <p> The Council applauded Dr. Shum on her appointment. Dr. Shum noted that leading the DER staff is both a privilege and an honor and that staff will
    continue to work with the Council in support of research. </p>
  <p> Dr. Somerman also announced that Dr. Isabel Garcia will be retiring as Deputy Director of the NIDCR to become Dean of the University of Florida,
    College of Dentistry, in February 2015. Dr. Garcia has served more than 34 years in the U.S. Public Health Service, in which she is an assistant
    surgeon general and rear admiral. For 19 of these years, Dr. Garcia has served the NIDCR in key leadership positions, including as Acting Director of
    the NIDCR in 2010-2011. Dr. Somerman praised Dr. Garcia for her many accomplishments at the NIDCR, which include directing the institute&#39;s dental
    public health resident program, spearheading the development of three strategic plans, and representing the NIDCR on many high-visibility committees
    across the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services. Dr. Somerman noted in particular Dr. Garcia&#39;s strategic thinking, leadership skills, integrity, and commitment. She anticipated that Dr. Garcia will continue to provide valuable strategic
    input to the NipCR and NIH, but now from the academic/dean&#39;s perspective. </p>
<p> Dr. Garcia remarked that the NIDCR has been more of a family than a place to work for her and has been integral to her development. She noted that she
    looks forward to continuing to work with the Council in a different capacity, and she thanked the Council for its continued support. Dr. Garcia also
thanked Dr. Somerman for her support during this transition period. </p>
  <p><strong>Recent Congressional Activities </strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Somerman reported on two main activities. She noted that the majority and minority clerks of the Senate Appropriations Labor, Health, and Human
    Services Committee and the Education Subcommittee recently came to the NIH to meet with institute and center (IC) directors and discuss IC research
    priorities and initiatives. Dr. Somerman also reported that congressional leaders are developing legislation for the Congress&#39; &quot;21st Century Cures
    Initiative&quot; and intend to complete draft legislation by January 2015. Dr. Somerman noted that this effort has significant momentum and has included a series of
    roundtable discussions around the country in many of which Dr. Francis Collins, Director, NIH, has participated. </p>
  <p> Commenting on the NIH budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, which begins October 1, 2014, Dr. Somerman anticipated that the Congress would pass a
    Continuing Resolution by September 30, which would continue the budget at FY 2014 levels until further action. </p>
  <p><strong>The NIH Common Fund </strong></p>
  <p> In June 2014, the NIH celebrated the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the NIH Common Fund. Dr. Somerman noted that the Common Fund was established by former NIH
    director Dr. Elias Zerhouni in 2003 as a &quot;Roadmap for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Biomedicine&quot; and supports trans-NIH extramural research that is transformational,
    catalytic, and synergistic. The aim is to jump-start research that is unique, innovative, and cross-cutting. Through a strategic planning process
    similar to that conducted in the ICs, lead staff from the ICs identify broad topic areas for Fund support and then refine these, with input from the
    extramural community, into well-defined programs and initiatives. </p>
  <p> Dr. Somerman highlighted a few research areas supported by the fund and involving the NIDCR. She noted, for example, that the Molecular Libraries
    initiative, begun in 2004, has resulted thus far in the development of approximately 390,000 unique and diverse compounds that are available for
    research. The Human Microbiome Project, begun in 2007, is transforming the understanding of health and disease and has led to major findings about the role of the gut, for example, in overall immunity, malnutrition, obesity, and autoimmune diseases. The NIDCR was a lead IC in organizing this project, and the oral site was
    selected as one of five sites for focus. Dr. Somerman noted that NIDCR&#39; s support of research in this area includes launching of a project to identify
    microbial species that are presently uncultivable, which may account for up to 80 percent of the more than 700 species found in the oral cavity.
    Through this project, researchers are developing the ability to image complex oral communities and are sharing big data internationally. </p>
<p> Dr. Somerman also highlighted the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) project through which the NIDCR supports research
    to develop and validate patient-reported outcomes in oral health. She further noted that the NIDCR funds several awards under the High-Risk Research
program, including the NIH Director&#39;s Pioneer Award, the NIH Director&#39;s Early Independence Award, and the NIH Director&#39;s New Innovator Award. </p>
  <p> Dr. Somerman noted that over the past 10 years the Common Fund has developed and supported approximately 30 programs and has enabled the ICs to
    accelerate research and launch new and different projects across many fields. For the NIDCR, this support has made possible, for example, development
    of knockout-mice phenotypes, research to identify and evaluate targets ofbehavioral change, and launching of the glycomics initiative. Dr. Somerman
    noted that she co-chairs, with Dr. Jon R. Lorsch, Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the Common Fund&#39;s Glycoscience Working Group, which
    aims to stimulate the production of carbohydrate materials, tools, and techniques for research and data integration and analysis. </p>
  <p><strong>NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy </strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Somerman announced that research grant applications submitted to the NIH for a January 25, 2015, receipt date and beyond must include plans for
    sharing of genomic data in accordance with the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy, which replaces the NIH&#39;s draft GDS Policy. The final policy
    applies to all NIH-funded, large-scale human and non-human projects that generate genomic data. It was posted in the <em>Federal Register </em>August
    26, 2014; published in the <em>NIH Guidefor Grants and Contracts </em>August 27, 2014; and can be accessed at <a href="http://gds.nih.gov/" target="_blank">http://gds.nih.gov/</a>. She invited Council members to contact Dr. Emily Harris, Chief of the Translational Genomics
    Research Branch (TGRB), DER, regarding questions about the policy. </p>
  <p><strong>V. CONCEPT CLEARANCE</strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Dombroski described the process for development of NIDCR concepts, or initiatives. She noted that the Council plays an important role through its
    formal review, discussion, and approval of concepts. The NIDCR staff presented six concepts for the Council&#39;s consideration. </p>
  <p> <u>Novel or Enhanced Dental Restorative Materials for Class V Lesions</u> </p>
  <p> Dr. Jane C. Atkinson, Director, Center for Clinical Research, DER, presented a concept, which was developed in collaboration with Dr. James L.
    Drummond, Program Director, Dental and Biomaterials Program, Integrative Biology and Infectious Diseases Branch (IBIDB), DER, to support research to
    develop novel or enhanced Class V restorative materials. She noted that the materials should be capable of protecting and strengthening the remaining
    non-carious root structure, restoring tooth structure and function, and maintaining the integrity of the restorative margins and surrounding
    periodontal tissues. Also, the materials should have a longer clinical service life than those currently available and, ideally, would integrate with the dentin-cementum interface. </p>
<p> Dr. Atkinson noted that restorations placed at the gum line when tooth structure has been lost fail more quickly than restorations placed in dentin and
    enamel and that early failure is associated with older-aged (2: 50 years) individuals, who also are at increased risk for Class V caries. As
    populations become increasingly older and individuals retain their teeth, there is an increasing need for improved materials. The materials to be
    developed could demonstrate improved bonding to organic and inorganic structures, accommodation oflarge fluctuations in water content, protection ofthe
    dentin and cementum from dissolution, and the ability to remain intact even when the encircling tooth structure degrades. Ideally, they also should
    resist changes in the oral microflora, have increased resistance to flexing forces from mastication, potentially integrate with surrounding soft
tissues, be esthetic and biocompatible, and have excellent handling properties. </p>
  <p> The Council&#39;s discussants, Dr. Teresa Ann Dolan and Dr. Anne C. Tanner, supported the concept. Dr. Dolan noted that the concept is excellently
    prepared, comprehensive and inclusive, and consistent with the NIDCR&#39;s strategic plan, and it promotes interdisciplinary research collaboration. She
    also noted that the concept addresses important clinical needs and that the NIDCR does not currently fund development of restorative materials for root
    surfaces. Dr. Tanner commented on the increasing problem of dental and root caries among older individuals, especially elderly persons, and among
    individuals who are immunocompromised. She noted the limitations of current restorative materials and the need for improved and effective ones, and she
    encouraged support for multidisciplinary research teams that have an understanding of microbial complexities. </p>
  <p> In discussion, Drs. Atkinson and Drummond stated that the concept is sufficiently broad  to include additional research opportunities, including, for example, development of slow-release, fluoride-containing materials or subgingival
    restorations and, potentially Class V-combined as well as Class V materials. They commented that materials may fail for different reasons and that the
    success of novel and enhanced materials could be evaluated in clinical trials in the future. </p>
  <p> The Council unanimously approved the concept.</p>
 <p><u>Pharmacogenomics of Orofacial Pain Management</u> </p>
  <p> Dr. John W. Kusiak, Acting Chief, IBIDB, and Program Director, Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience Program, IBIDB, DER, presented a proposed concept
    for research on the pharmacogenomics of orofacial pain management. The goal is to encourage research on the impact of genetics on the variability of
    responses to therapeutic drugs among individuals with painful conditions. An expected outcome is that the research will provide the scientific basis
    for development of precision therapeutics for chronic pain conditions. Dr. Kusiak stated that chronic pain, a complex condition, is now considered a
    disease in itself and affects up to 100 million Americans. He noted that individuals vary widely in their sensitivity to pain, susceptibility to
    developing and coping with chronic pain, and the efficacy and adverse effects of analgesic treatments. While the prevalence of chronic pain conditions is higher among women, gender differences in pain sensitivity are less clear. </p>
<p> Dr. Kusiak mentioned that pharmacogenomics is playing an important role in the treatment of other complex disorders, such as cancer, diabetes, and
    cardiovascular disease. He noted that whereas the pharmacogenomics of opioid-based analgesia is well known, it is less well known for other treatments.
    In addition, new targets for treating chronic pain conditions are being developed. Dr. Kusiak said the time is ripe for pursuing this concept, as
    multiple cohorts could be probed in the research, pain researchers have a heightened interest in genomic studies and overlapping chronic pain
    conditions (e.g., temporomandibular joint disorder), and pharmacogenomics is evolving from use of a single candidate-gene approach to genome-wide
    methods. He anticipated that the proposed research could be a catalyst across the pain research community to advance treatment beyond opioid-based
analgesia. </p>
  <p> The Council discussants, Dr. Mary L. Marazita and Dr. Anne Louise Oaklander, strongly supported the concept. Dr. Marazita said it is very timely and
    ultimately could lead to more personalized approaches for treating acute and chronic pain. She noted that it is appropriate to encourage use of
    additional genomic methods, to develop new targets, and to explore gender differences. Dr. Marazita encouraged the NIDCR to include in the concept the
    pharmacogenomics of pain in children as well as family and cultural contexts of pain. Dr. Oaklander noted that the concept would build on data being
    obtained elsewhere. She highlighted the need to identify more patient-related outcomes and to better understand interpersonal differences of response
    to pain treatments. She noted that the research could lead to development of better pain targets for at-risk patients. </p>
  <p> The Council unanimously approved the concept. </p>
  <p> <u>Immune System Plasticity in the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Complex</u><br/> Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Diseases </p>
  <p> Dr. Amanda Melillo, Acting Director, Salivary Biology and Immunology Program, IBIDB, DER, presented a concept to encourage contemporary, systematic
    research approaches to elucidate the role of immune system plasticity in health and in the pathogenesis of dental, oral, and craniofacial diseases. The
    expectation is that new knowledge derived from this research will facilitate development of novel immunomodulatory-based therapies to prevent or
    reverse the progression of disease. Dr. Melillo noted that the proposed concept spans the IBIDB program areas. Describing the plasticity of the immune
    system as both &quot;a friend and foe,&quot; she enumerated three objectives for the research-to understand the mediators of homeostasis in health and disease;
    to elucidate the role of immune system plasticity in the development and pathology of disease; and to develop practical, clinically targeted approaches
    for restoration of normal tissue homeostasis. </p>
  <p> The focus areas for the proposed research would include identification of genetic loci for inflammatory diseases and environmental factors that
    contribute to immune dysfunction; exploration of cellular and molecular pathways that maintain normal tissue homeostasis and the mechanisms of their
    disruption in disease-specific states (e.g., periodontal diseases, oral cancer, Sjögren&#39;s syndrome); and pursuit of systems biology approaches to understand immune plasticity in health and disease and to investigate key signaling
    networks as potential targets for diagnosis and treatment. Additional focus areas include the development of new and better animal models reflecting
    human disease for use in testing therapeutic strategies and the development of tools and technologies, including bioengineering approaches, for precise
    modulation of immune system function to restore health. </p>
<p> The three Council discussants, Dr. Yvonne L. Kapila, Dr. Jane B. Lian, and Dr. Richard Peters Darveau, enthusiastically supported the concept. They
    commented that it is broad, timely, and key to comparing, contrasting, and ultimately understanding health and disease. Dr. Kapila noted as well that
the concept would coordinate diverse investigator-initiated research and aligns with NIDCR goals for multidisciplinary research. </p>
  <p> The Council unanimously approved the concept.</p>
  <p> <u>Oral HIVacc: Oral Mucosal Immunization Approaches for HIV Prevention</u></p>
  <p> Dr. Isaac R. Rodriguez-Chavez, Program Director, NIDCR AIDS and Immunosuppression Program, IBIDB, DER, presented a concept to support the development and testing of novel prophylactic HIV vaccines for direct administration into oral lymphoid tissues to trigger protective local and systemic immunity. The
    expected outcome is that the research will lead to development of novel oral prophylactic HIV vaccine formulations with or without novel mucosal
    adjuvants that will be ready for preclinical testing in animal models. Dr. Rodriguez­Chavez set forth five priority areas for this research.
    These are to (a) define the mechanisms of HIV vaccine-induced oral and systemic immunity upon direct immunization of oral lymphoid tissues; (b)
    determine the mechanisms by which novel adjuvants enhance vaccine-induced immunity; (c) test novel oral HIV vaccine vectors that express viral antigens
    to trigger protective immunity; (d) compare different oral mucosal HIV vaccination approaches to maximize protection; and (e) delineate HIV
    vaccine-induced changes in oral and immune cell subsets and their interactions to enhance immunity. </p>
  <p> The Council discussants, Dr. J. Leslie Winston and Dr. Richard Peters Darveau, supported the concept. Dr. Winston commented that, during the past year,
    much evidence has been reported about the role of oral mucosa in HIV vaccine prevention, and she encouraged the NIDCR to take ownership of this
    research. She also noted that the research could provide a good model system for studying the oral mucosa&#39;s involvement in other diseases. Dr. Darveau
    noted the importance of developing an oral anti-HIV vaccine as there are no efficacious HIV vaccines yet. He commended the NIDCR for this effort. </p>
  <p> The Council unanimously approved the con<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4em;">ce</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4em;">pt.</span></p>
  <p> <u>Effects of E-cigarette Aerosol Mixtures on Oral and Periodontal Epithelia</u> </p>
  <p> Dr. Sundar Venkatachalam, Program Director, Epithelial Cell and Regulation and Transformation Program, IBIDB, DER, presented a concept to support
    research on the cellular and genetic effects of electronic (e)-cigarette aerosol mixtures. In this research, the NIDCR would encourage use of appropriate in vitro and in vivo model systems to study the genotoxicity, proliferation, cell death, and cellular transformation
    of oral and periodontal epithelia. The concept would address the following four gaps in knowledge about e-cigarettes: the effects on oral and
    periodontal epithelial; the effects on the oral microbiome; genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and proliferation; and identity of individual components and
    their effects. </p>
<p> Dr. Venkatachalam noted that e-cigarettes have become widely popular in the past 3 years and, although they are thought to be safe and are marketed as
    a smoking-cessation approach, they are not regulated and there are no data on their safety or efficacy. He said that approximately 460 different
e-cigarette brands using 7,700 unique flavors are on the market. In addition to delivering nicotine in aerosol form, e-cigarettes also deliver several dozen other chemicals, of which at least eight are known carcinogens.
    Conventional cigarette brands, in contrast, use approximately 4,000 chemicals, of which 69 are known carcinogens. In the United States, in 2012, sales
    of e-cigarettes amounted to an estimated $1.7 billion, and almost 7 percent of middle school and high school children used e-cigarettes, which is twice
    the percentage in 2011. </p>
  <p> The three Council discussants, Mr. Jeffrey A. Kaufman, Dr. J. Leslie Winston, and Dr. Benjamin Alexander White, Jr., strongly supported the concept.
    Mr. Kaufman elaborated on the extent of the rapidly increasing use of e-cigarettes, noting that 20 percent of smokers also usee­ cigarettes, while
    an estimated 10 percent of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes in 2012 had never used conventional cigarettes before. Although thought
    to be safer because the delivery method doesn&#39;t involve inhaled vapor, e-cigarettes have additional carcinogens, including neurotoxins, in large
    quantities. Mr. Kaufman noted that the NIDCR can play a crucial role in supporting research to obtain data and promote health, and the research
    framework and tools that are developed could be applicable in assessing other public health concerns. </p>
 
  <p> Dr. Winston observed that the commercial availability of e-cigarettes is shocking as so  little is known about the potential health effects. She said the NIDCR has a responsibility to address this issue, and she encouraged outreach to the
    public and health professionals as data and information are obtained. Noting that the written concept emphasizes use of 3-dimensional cultures, Dr.
    Winston encouraged the NIDCR to allow for broader use of different systems, especially in the beginning of this research so as to establish those that
    are most efficacious. In discussion, Dr. Venkatachalam noted that the NIDCR would encourage use of any clinically appropriate innovative modeling. </p>
  <p> Dr. White noted that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sought public comment on potential regulation of e-cigarettes and that NIDCR-supported
    research could be informative to the development of Federal regulations and warning labels. Dr. White noted that the proposed concept is consistent
    with the NIDCR strategic plan and the NIH research mission. </p>
  <p> In discussion, Dr. White noted that the FDA&#39;s regulation of tobacco products began in 2009 and that many brands of e-cigarettes do not include
    nicotine, but do have various flavors, the safety of which also is unknown. Dr. Venkatachalam said that approximately 1,000 incidents of toxicity from
    overdoses, accidental exposure, and ingestion of nicotine solution in e-cigarettes have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    in each of the past 2 years. Dr. Isabel Garcia noted that use of e-cigarettes among pregnant women and in underserved populations is a particular concern. Others noted the need to address behavioral factors involved in the use of e-cigarettes, as there is no age
    restriction on their use currently, and to include assessment of individuals&#39; exposures in studies of immune function in oral health and disease. </p>
  <p> The Council unanimously approved the concept.</p>
  <p><u>NIDCR Institutional Research Training Programs</u> </p>
  <p> Dr. Lynn Mertens King, Chief, RTCDB, DEA, presented a proposed concept to sustain and strengthen a robust and diverse biomedical research workforce
    dedicated to improving dental, oral, and craniofacial health. The outcome would be comprehensive institutional training programs that provide novel and
    innovative research training experiences; offer integrated and multidisciplinary training opportunities; and flexibly support dual-degree (D.D.S.-Ph.D.
    or D.M.D.-Ph.D.) and predoctoral Ph.D. students and postdoctoral trainees, including individuals who are not U.S. citizens. Dr. King noted that these
    programs provide an entry into research career pathways and a strong foundation of research experience that fosters a successful transition to obtaining individual research support. Eligible institutions should have a strong record of training individuals whose accomplishments and
    subsequent positions benefit the biomedical research enterprise. The program would align with several ongoing NIH programs, specifically the NIH
    Diversity in the Biomedical Research Workforce, the Biomedical Research Workforce, and the Physician Scientist Workforce initiatives. </p>
  <p> Dr. King noted the NIDCR currently funds a spectrum of pre- and postdoctoral full-time training programs using individual fellowships and institutional
    training activities. In addition, the NIDCR supports a number of early career development awards for research training of postdoctoral students and
    junior faculty. The NIDCR utilizes a range of funding activities for this support-institutional T32 and T90/R90 awards, individual fellowships (F30,
    F31, F32), institutional K12 awards, career development awards (K08, K23, K25), career transition awards (K22, K99/ROO), independent scientist awards
    (K02), and research supplements to promote diversity. </p>
  <p> The Council discussants, Dr. Pamela K. Den Besten and Dr. Jane A. Weintraub, strongly supported continuation of the NIDCR&#39;s successful comprehensive
    research training and career development program as necessary to sustaining the future workforce pipeline. In discussion, the Council noted the
    importance of being able to monitor and track research trainees to encourage a diverse workforce. Staff noted that new tracking efforts are under way
    at the NIH and that the NIDCR anticipates developing a mentorship program in the dental community for all individuals seeking research training
    mentoring and support. </p>
  <p> The Council unanimously approved the concept. </p>
  <p> <strong>VI. INTRODUCTION: SPECIAL SESSION ON BIG DATA </strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Steve Scholnick, Program Director, Developmental Biology and Genetics Program, TGRB, DER, introduced three speakers who presented different
    perspectives on big data—as a digital enterprise for the NIH, as a user in the research community, and as a technological challenge. Dr. Schohiick noted that the NIH Big Data to
    Knowledge (BD2K) initiative is facilitating the movement of biomedical science into the era of big data. Each speaker&#39;s presentation is summarized below.</p>
  <p> <strong>VII. NIH AS A DIGITAL ENTERPRISE </strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Philip Bourne, the first-ever NIH Associate Director for Data Science, presented an overview of the BD2K initiative at the NIH. He noted that the
    timeline leading to an office of data science at the NIH began in 2010 when Dr. Francis Collins, Director, NIH, established the Data and Informatics
    Working Group to address the issue of big data for the NIH. The working group&#39;s report was presented to the Advisory Committee to the Director, NIH, in
    June 2012 and led to creation of the position of Associate Director for Data Science and a series of new awards. </p>
  <p> Dr. Bourne noted that, in October 2014, the NIH announced awards for 11 centers of excellence, a BD2K-Library oflntegrated Network-Based Cellular
    Signatures (LINCS)­Perturbation Data Coordination and Integration Center, development of a Data Discovery Index, research grants in software
    development and analysis methods, and research training and career development. He noted that the mission statement for the digital enterprise is &quot;to
    foster an ecosystem that enables biomedical research to be conducted as a digital enterprise that enhances health, lengthens life, and reduces illness
    and disability.&quot; Dr. Bourne emphasized that that the ecosystem comprises collaborations across Federal agencies (in the Open Data 2.0 initiative) as
    well as interactions with the private sector (e.g., corporations, professional organizations, foundations). He stated that the goals for BD2K, on which
    the NIH will spend an estimated $1 billion in FY 2014-2015, are to achieve sustainability, efficiency, collaboration, reproducibility, integration, accessibility, quality, and training in the science
    of big data. </p>
  <p> Dr. Bourne noted that the office of the NIH Associate Director for Data Science is focusing on five programmatic themes for the NIH and is guided by a
    Scientific Data Council and an External Advisory Board. He elaborated on the deliverables and features of the themes, which are sustainability,
    education, innovation, process, and collaboration. He noted, for example, that to assure sustainability of the enterprise, the NIH has developed the
    concept of a commons, whereby government, academia, and private sector stakeholders can &quot;drop off&#39; data for storage and sharing (e.g., through the
    cloud or high-performance computing centers) and would be charged for access to and use of the data. Dr. Bourne said that the NIH will begin to develop
    this concept through pilot projects and is about to issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement for this program. </p>
  <p> With regard to education (in data science), the focus will be on training-development of a sufficient cadre of researchers skilled in the science of
    big data, elevation of general competencies in data usage and analysis across the biomedical research workforce, and, possibly, creation of a virtual
    or on-site training center. Dr. Bourne noted that promotion of innovation is already under way via the BD2K awards for centers of excellence, data discovery, software development, and data coordination and integration. Efforts are also under
    way to enhance the process of data science by, for example, improving harmonization of clinical data across ICs, accepting validity for data citations,
    and exploring new models and audiences to review grant applications in data science. Examples ofNIH efforts to build collaboration across the ICs, other agencies, and internationally (e.g., on software infrastmcture) include the
    planning oftwo joint workshops with the National Science Foundation, involvement in the Open Data 2.0 initiative, and NIH&#39;s participation in HIRO and
    ELIXIR. </p>
 <p> In discus<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4em;">sion, the</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4em;"> Council commended the NIH for riding &quot;the wave of the future&quot; and taking on the enormously exciting BD2K challenges to communicate
    and share biomedical and behavioral research information in new ways and to move the scientific enterprise more toward collaboration, instead of
    competition. Inresponse to an expressed concern that little useful is being done with the vast amounts of data being developed, Dr. Bourne noted that the NIH views its role as a facilitator in this regard and aims to improve
    the quality and curation of research data. The Council also mentioned the need to better prepare students to take advantage of big-data methods and
    collaboration. Dr. Bourne mentioned that the demand for data scientists, especially in biomedicine, far surpasses the supply available and that the NIH
    is exploring training needs and innovative approaches (e.g., for submission and review of research proposals).</span></p>
  <p> <strong>VIII. BIG DATA FROM A USER&#39;S PERSPECTIVE </strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Mary L. Marazita, Director, Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics, School of Dental Medicine, University ofPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the
    Council&#39;s representative to the NIH&#39;s BD2K Working Group, presented a user&#39;s perspective ofbig data. She focused her remarks on human genomics data,
    but noted that there are many other areas of big data in biomedicine, including, for example, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, phenomics, and
    digital patient records. </p>
  <p> Dr. Marazita noted that the magnitude of big data in human genomics (i.e., the human gene map) has grown—from 25 genes (reported in 1973) to 2,235 genes
    (reported in 1991) and, subsequently, to some 20,500 genes (in 2003) with completion of the Human Genome Project. Researchers can now access published
    genome-wide associations (GWAS) for approximately 2,300 common, complex disorders; complete gene maps for approximately 5,300 rare human disorders; and
    chromosomal maps for millions of markers. Dr. Marazita noted that scientists are only beginning to comprehend the complexity of the issues involved in
    using these data. She highlighted, from a user&#39;s perspective, five key issues: data acquisition, data storage, data analysis, privacy/identifiability,
    and public access/credit. She touched on some of the complexities of each issue. </p>
  <p> With regard to data acquisition, Dr. Marazita noted that key questions relate to samples (e.g., how to get which samples, obtaining appropriate
    consent), study designs (e.g., genotyping or sequencing, use ofin-house or specialized facilities), and data delivery (e.g., which format and media to
    use). With regard to data storage, she described the evolution of storage possibilities— from punch cards to tapes and disks to enormous storage
    farms which users now access from the cloud. She noted that users may not have enough storage for their own projects, as individual data sets may now
    comprise 100,000 files. When considering storage, users have to decide whether to access centralized or distributed data sets, obtain knowledge of and
    access to public databases (requiring specialized information technology professionals and annotation of data sets), and be able to retrieve appropriately curated data for their specific analyses. Dr. Marazita said that more than 50 percent of a researcher&#39;s time can be spent in
    data wrangling before even beginning analysis of the data. </p>
  <p> With regard to data analysis, she highlighted the need for ever more computer horsepower and new statistical methods for genetic analysis. She noted
    two barriers in using publicly available data—lack of computer capacity and training [including training of institutional review boards (IRBs)].
    Possible solutions include development of results databases and/or those mentioned by Dr. Bourne (see above), which include the NIH commons approach,
    interface tools for using data sets, and centralized computer facilities. </p>
  <p> With regard to privacy/identifiability, Dr. Marazita noted that assuring the privacy of individuals&#39; data is becoming a larger issue as more data are
    accumulated. Concerns relate to the impact for IRBs and the maintenance of public databases to prevent hackers from accessing individual data and
    identifiable genomic or metagenomics sequencing. She anticipated that protection of privacy/identifiability will continue to be vigorously discussed. </p>
  <p> With regard to public access/credit, Dr. Marazita commented that, in 2000, President Clinton declared that the human genome sequence was not patentable
    and should be made freely available. She noted that the new NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy, which was issued in August 2014 and expands the GWAS
    policy to all large-scale genomic studies, with the eventual aim of making genomic data immediately available to the public, has generated concerns
    among researchers, young faculty, and study participants. Two particular concerns are public access to individuals&#39; data and how researchers will
    receive credit for obtaining and providing data. Dr. Marazita noted that most producers of data are also consumers of data and that the number of
    consumers who are not producers is increasing. Meeting the expectations of academics and consumers will thus be a challenge. </p>
  <p> In discussion, the Council mentioned two additional concerns related to the heterogeneity of the data being developed and the number of people who will
    eventually benefit from very costly &quot;omic&#39;&#39; analyses. Dr. Marazita agreed that there are many questions about big data and that they include the cost
    of gathering, sharing, and analyzing data for use in personalized medicine and the ability to translate data to larger groups. </p>
  <p><strong>IX. ADDRESSING BIG DATA CHALLENGES: TECHNOLOGIES AND SOLUTIONS </strong></p>
  <p> Dr. Carl Kesselman, Professor, Epstein Department of lndustrial and Systems Engineering, Information Sciences Institute Fellow, University of Southern
    California, Los Angeles, explored some technological solutions related to the five issues Dr. Marazita addressed (see above). He limited his remarks to
    research that he and his colleagues are conducting. </p>
  <p> Dr. Kesselman noted that the increasingly large amounts of data available in the biomedical big data landscape present a situation that is both better
    and worse than before. With the increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data being accumulated, there is an increasing need to combine multiple
    data in cross-cutting analytic methods, to share data and knowledge within and across projects, and to integrate data into a formal, standard, clean, consistent, accessible, and linked representation for analysis and sharing. He agreed
    with Dr. Marazita that data wrangling is often the most resource-intensive part of data analysis, and he noted that big data in biomedical research is
    often a cottage industry, in which researchers are developing their own pipelines, scripts, and storage methods that become barriers to entry for
    others. He depicted how big data permeates the scientific lifecycle and emphasized the need to develop methods and tools that can be used iteratively
    to intersect this cycle at each phase (e.g., data collection, data analysis, and data storage). He noted that the big data challenge-to develop
    technologies and methods for acquisition, management, integration analysis, annotation, and publication of large, complex biomedical data, including
    genetics, imaging, and clinical data—should be easy to streamline, but is not. </p>
  <p> Dr. Kesselman offered a possible solution to the challenge-that is, develop a scalable infrastructure for data-driven biomedical research that has at
    its core a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform similar to that used by Google&#39;s Gmail. The ecosystem of big data would draw data from various sources,
    utilize community-developed algorithms and analytics for data analysis, and rely on public and private cloud computing and storage. </p>
  <p> Dr. Kesselman elaborated on different phases of the scientific lifecycle. With regard to data acquisition, he noted the diverse file types and large
    data sizes that would be acquired from different sources; the need to use controlled vocabularies to characterize data for discovery, management, and curation; and some typical tools for data management (e.g., directory hierarchies, coding of metadata, spreadsheets, one-off databases). He highlighted the NIDCR-supported FaceBase as a resource that facilitates data management. </p>
  <p> With regard to data movement and storage, Dr. Kesselman mentioned three possible solutions (the pure cloud model, pure local model, and hybrid cloud
    model). He emphasized that locality of data is critical when selecting the best solution. With regard to data processing and analytics, Dr. Kesselman
    noted that while diverse platforms and frameworks (e.g., data-mining algorithms and high-performance and high-throughput computing for large and
    smaller data sets) are available, being able to record the provenance of data processing is critical for repeatability. He also noted that a wide range
    of &quot;pipeline&quot; tools are available for doing complex analyses, are auditable and repeatable, and could be scaled up. Two such tools are the LONI
    Pipeline and the Globus Genomics (Galaxy) Pipeline. </p>
  <p> With regard to public access, Dr. Kesselman noted that data could be placed into public repositories, which may be domain repositories or
    laboratory/institutional repositories. Commenting on the issue of credit, he noted that methods for citation of data sets are emerging, such as the
    digital object identifier (DOl) for creating a permanent identifier for a data set. </p>
  <p> In conclusion, Dr. Kesselman quoted 10 simple rules for the care and feeding of scientific data (see <a href="http://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/3410%29" target="_blank">https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/3410</a><u>).</u> These include sharing data online
    with permanent identifiers, publishing workflows as context, linking data to publications, publishing one&#39;s codes, saying how one wants to get credit
    for data, fostering and using data repositories, and, overall, being a booster for data science. </p>
