<p>Dr. Alicia Dombroski, Executive  Secretary, NADCRC, also welcomed the Council members,  guests, and virtual participants. She  invited the Council  to consider and approve the minutes of the January  27, 2015, Council  meeting. &#160;The Council unanimously approved the minutes.</p>

<p><strong>REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, NIDCR </strong></p>

<p>Dr. Somerman invited Council&#39;s questions  on the written Director&#39;s Report to Council:  May 2015, which was provided  to the Council members and is available  on the <a href="/Pages/default.aspx">NIDCR website</a>. Later, following a presentation on the Precision  Medicine Initiative at the NIH, Dr. Somerman reported on NIDCR activities to advance precision  oral health care through research (see section VII below).</p>
<p><strong>V. SPECIAL SESSION ON THE NIDCR PATHWAY TO INDEPENDENCE (K99/ROO) PROGRAMS</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Leslie Frieden, Extramural Training Officer, Research  Training and Career Development Branch,  DEA, presented&#160; an overview of the NIDCR Pathway to Independence Awards (K99/ROO) programs. &#160;Following her presentation, she introduced two invited speakers  who shared their experiences in utilizing these programs to gain research independence.</p>
<p><strong>K99/ROO Overview</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Frieden  described the NIDCR&#39;s  use of the K99/ROO  award mechanism, the characteristics of K99/ROO applicants and awardees, and the outcomes  thus far. &#160;She noted that the NIDCR supports  a broad range of research  training programs, which include individual and institutional awards,  intramural and extramural  training, career opportunities for high school students up to established investigators, and research  supplements to promote  diversity and career re-entry.</p>
<p>Dr. Frieden specified that the NIDCR supports two distinct K99/ROO programs: the parent NIH Pathway to Independence Award, for which the NIDCR initiated support  in Fiscal Year (FY) 2007, and the NIDCR Dentist  Scientist Pathway to Independence Award,  which began in FY 2010. The goal of both is to enable postdoctoral trainees  to transition to tenure-track faculty positions at earlier stages in their careers. The  K99/ROO is a 5-year award that supports  mentored research training  in the K99 phase (1-2 years) and independent research  in the ROO phase (3-4 years). The NIDCR Dentist Scientist Pathway award offers  an optional 2-year extension of the ROO phase to accommodate part-time  dental specialty training,  for an award total of 7 years. For both programs, eligible  candidates may be U.S. citizens,  permanent residents, or non-citizens; must have a doctoral degree,  which for the NIDCR Dentist  Scientist Pathway award would be a dual D.D.S.-D.M.D. and Ph.D.; be in a mentored research  position; have fewer than 4 years of postdoctoral research; and be sponsored by a domestic  institution. For awardees, 75 percent of their effort is protected research time, and 25 percent  may be dedicated to non-research activities, including clinical  practice, clinical training,  teaching, and administrative responsibilities. For the K99 phase, each awardee receives $75,000 as salary and $25,000  for research; for the ROO phase, each receives $249,000  in total costs.</p>
<p>Dr. Frieden highlighted possible career pathways  by which citizens and non-citizens could utilize NIH mechanisms of support to obtain NIH postdoctoral research  training, proceed to a K99/ROO,  and eventually attain independent research  and career development support. Summarizing data on the characteristics of K99/ROO  applicants and awardees,  Dr. Frieden noted the following  points. (a) The number ofNIDCR  applications for K99 awards is small and fluctuates (in FY 2014, there were 14 applications for the NIH parent award and 6 for the NIDCR Dentist  Scientist award); (b) the overall  success rates are higher than the average  for the NIH (50 percent  and 33 percent respectively in FY 2014, compared  with 22 percent for the NIH); (c) the mix of citizen and non-citizen applicants and awardees  is approximately equal (of the 115 applicants  and 51 awardees for the NIDCR K99/ROO  in FY 2010-FY 2014, 59 percent were citizens and 41  percent were non-citizens); (d)  postdoctoral and predoctoral T32 awards are the most frequent  prior NIH training  support, excluding non-citizens; and (e) the NIDCR  is the largest source of prior training  support for the awardees.</p>
<p>Dr. Frieden noted  specifically that (f) introduction of the NIDCR Dentist  Scientist Pathway K99/ROO in FY 2010  increased the number  of D.D.S.-Ph.D. applicants; (g) dual-degree dentist scientists comprised a higher  number of K99/ROO applicants and awardees in FY 2010-FY 2014 than in FY 2007-FY  2009 (24 and 10, respectively, versus 11 and 3) and had a higher success rate (44 percent  versus 27 percent);  and (h) the 7-year project  period was used as an option (requested by 32 percent  and 40 percent of applicants and awardees, respectively). Dr. Frieden mentioned that the NIH has few K99/ROO physician-scientist (M.D.-Ph.D.) applicants (e.g., 34, compared  with 700 Ph.D. applicants, in FY 2012).</p>
<p>Dr. Frieden highlighted outcomes  of the two NIDCR K99/ROO programs. In the NIH parent K99/ROO program,  the NIDCR made 41 awards beginning in FY 2007 through FY 2014. Of these,  13 are active K99s, 25 transitioned to ROOs, and 3 did not transition. Of the 25 awardees in  the ROO phase, 18 transitioned to a new institution and 7 transitioned within their training institution. The median  time spent in the K99 phase prior to transitioning to the ROO phase was 12 months  (with a range of 6-38 months). In the NIDCR Dentist  Scientist K99/ROO program, the NIDCR  made 10 awards beginning in FY 2010 through FY 2014. Of these, 4 are active K99s and 6 transitioned to ROOs.  &#160;Of the 6, 2 received 5-year  project periods, to accommodate part-time  clinical specialty training,  and 4 requested 3-year project periods; 5 individuals transitioned in place,  while 1 transitioned to a new institution. The median time in the K99 phase prior to transitioning to the ROO phase was 24.5 months  (with a range of 24-27 months).</p>
<p>Dr. Frieden reported that 234  publications are attributed to NIDCR K99/ROO  awardees in FY 2007-FY 2014. She noted that the award facilitated achievement of tenure-track research  faculty positions: That is, 33 (or 65  percent) of awardees have research-intensive independent positions, 16 (or 31 percent) have research-intensive dependent positions, and 8 are in industry or research-related positions. Of the 25 individuals who transitioned to the ROO phase in the NIH parent K99/ROO program, 21 have applied  for an NIH research project grant (RPG) and 12 have received  an RPG, while 19 have applied for an independent investigator-initiated RPG (R01),  and 9 have received an R01.</p>
<p>In closing, Dr. Frieden said that continued evaluation and tracking of the two K99/ROO programs are necessary  to establish comprehensive outcomes. She  noted that in FY 2012, based on the success  of the NIH K99/ROO program, the NIH Advisory  Committee to the Director&#39;s Biomedical  Workforce Working Group recommended that the NIH increase the number of K99/ROO awards supported. And in July 2014, in recognition of the success ofthe NIDCR Dentist Scientist Pathway K99/ROO, the NIH Advisory  Committee to the Director&#39;s NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce  Working Group recommended that the NIH develop a K99/ROO tailored  to physician scientists.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>In response  to questions, Dr. Frieden said that dental schools hired 100 percent  of the ROO awardees in the NIDCR Dentist Scientist  K99/ROO program and approximately 60 percent of the ROO awardees in the NIH parent K99/ROO  program. The Council commented on the ratio of citizens and non-citizens participating in the K99/ROO programs, the trend for trainees to remain at their institutions of training, and the need for flexibility by institutions to accommodate the 25 percent  of time required for specialty  training and clinical  duties. The Council encouraged the NIDCR to continue its outreach to inform dental  school deans, department chairs, and research groups about the importance  of the K99/ROO programs  for developing the dental scientists  who are very much needed in dental schools.</p>
<p><strong>Genetics and Genomics  of Cleft Lip and Palate in Sub-Saharan African Populations </strong></p>

<p>Dr. Azeez Butali, Assistant  Professor, Department of Oral Pathology, Radiology, and Medicine,  and Dows Research Institute, College  of Dentistry, University of Iowa, Iowa City, described  his career progression, from trainee to independence, and his current work on genetics and genomics of clefting. Dr. Butali said that he received  a degree in dentistry in 2001 from the University  of Lagos, Nigeria,  and that while serving as a dental intern, first experienced cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) in Sub-Saharan African children. After several  years of national service and private clinical practice  in periodontology, he entered a Ph.D. program in 2006 at the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center, University of Dundee, and received a Ph.D. in 2010, with a focus on dental facial deformities.</p>
<p>Dr. Butali related the progress he has made toward accomplishing his fourfold plan to: (i) work closely  with CL/P teams across Africa,  (ii) set up craniofacial birth defect registries in Africa, (iii) investigate the causes of orofacial clefts  in different groups,  and (iv) plan strategies for prevention.  &#160;He said that he has established close working relationships with government and non-government organizations across Africa, has been able thus far  to set up hospital registries of birth defects,  is developing the infrastructure to investigate causes  of orofacial clefts, and is collaborating on strategies for prevention. For the future, his plan is to influence  government policies to make craniofacial abnormalities a health  priority in Africa. Dr. Butali noted that through publications and conferences, such as the Pan African Association for Cleft Lip and Palate Meeting in 2006, and through groups,  such as the Nigerian Craniofacial Anomalies Network of 10 collaborating centers,  he has been able to enlist physicians and scientists across Africa to address CL/P and  promote registries and research.</p>
<p>Dr. Butali stated that his own research to understand the molecular genetics  of individual <em>CL/P </em>began in 2008 while he was a  visiting scholar in Dr. Jeffrey Murray&#39;s laboratory at the University  oflowa. On receiving a postdoctoral research  fellowship there in 2009, he focused  specifically on two genes implicated in <em>CL/P </em>in Asian populations, PAX7 and VAX7. On Dr. Murray&#39;s suggestion, he sought and received a K99/ROO award to provide a solid platform for becoming a successful independent researcher. Dr. Butali noted that the K99/ROO award enabled  him (a) to enhance his skills in scientific communication and writing (which  resulted in his publishing 10 articles and receiving four research grants,  including two from the NIDCR)  and (b) to broaden his understanding of the responsible conduct of research  (which led to his receiving  approval from institutional review boards for four applications and being named a faculty facilitator at the University  of Iowa).</p>
<p>Dr. Butali said that the K99/ROO experience and follow-up support has made it possible  to expand multidisciplinary collaborations on CL/P in Africa (e.g., through  the African Craniofacial Anomalies Network); to extend research  collaborations to identify  sub-clinical cleft phenotypes<br/>
in African populations; and to deepen his understanding of the genetics  of complex diseases across different populations. He noted that the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which have identified 16 loci associated with clefts are mainly representative of European and Asian populations. Dr. Butali emphasized the need to identify new risk loci specific to African  populations and to thereby gain additional insights  into the biology of non-syndromic clefts. He noted that he is currently funded to conduct the first GWAS of clefts in African  populations and to participate in multiethnic CL/P studies. In addition,  he is involved in next-generation sequencing studies of the exome to identify  and understand variants  in gene expression. This research will make possible  genetic counseling for at-risk families, primary prevention, and improved treatment to gain better outcomes.</p>
<p>Dr. Butali noted also that with the K99/ROO,  he benefited from having a strong and successful mentor and, in turn, has successfully mentored  undergraduate and dental  students from the United States and overseas  and has had the opportunity to advise and mentor postdoctoral fellows, associates, and young investigators, which include one K99/ROO awardee  and three current K99/ROO applicants. He said his vision  for the future is to continue to play a leading role in craniofacial research globally and to participate actively in the International Association for Dental Research  (IADR) Global Oral Health Inequalities Research Network (GOHIRN), the international Cleft Lip and Palate Association, and other global efforts to prevent cleft lip and palate.</p>
<p><strong>Salivary Glands and the Nervous System: A Story of Development and Regeneration </strong></p>
<p>Dr. Sarah Knox, Assistant  Professor, Department of Cell and Tissue Biology,  School of Dentistry,  University of California, San Francisco (UCSF),  described her transition from working in the NIDCR intramural program  to &quot;flying solo&quot;  in the extramural research community  via use of the K99/ROO  mechanism. She  emphasized that the K99/ROO award helped her move from intramural research  to extramural research  and to pursue her passion and enthusiasm for studying development and regeneration of salivary glands and the associated nervous  system.</p>
<p>Initially as an investigator in the intramural NIDCR Laboratory of Cell and Developmental Biology, led by Dr. Matthew Hoffman,  Dr. Knox focused  on neuronal-epithelial interactions regulating salivary  gland development and regeneration in mice. In this research, she observed that the parasympathetic ganglion  and salivary gland epithelium develop  in parallel and in 2006, submitted a K99/ROO application to investigate the importance of nerves in salivary gland development and, in particular, the role of secretory vesicles containing neurotransmitters  (e.g., acetylcholine). Subsequently with  K99/ROO support and  in collaboration with Dr. Hoffman  and others, she determined that neuronal signals  maintain K5+ progenitor cells, that neurturin produced by the end bud epithelium promotes the outgrowth of axons and the function  and survival of  neurons, and that treatment with neurturin after irradiation increases  glandular growth and restores parasympathetic function.  She and colleagues further found that patients with head and neck cancer who have been treated  with irradiation exhibit  a decreased number  of acini cells,  neurturin expression, and parasympathetic innervation. Dr. Knox noted that this finding,  which suggests that neurturin could be helpful  in restoring salivary  gland function in such patients,  was crucial to her later R01 application.</p>
<p>Dr. Knox noted that the K99/ROO  award facilitated her research development, skill in creating  and writing research  grant applications (for R21 and R01 awards),  and mentoring of research students. &#160;She remarked  that the award enabled her to attract  the attention of eight research  universities, from which she selected  the UCSF for pursuing the ROO phase. There,  she received guidance  and direction under the ROO to enable her to establish her own research  laboratory and to apply for an R01. Dr. Knox said that she also benefited  by being a member of a diverse  cohort of K99/ROO recipients.</p>
<p>Dr. Knox noted that her current  research builds on the foundation made possible by the K99/ROO award. She continues to focus on how nerves  guide the development and regeneration of organs, and in her laboratory, she and colleagues are working on mouse genetics,  adult regeneration, human fetal and adult tissues,  aging and senescence, and Sjögren&#39;s syndrome. In continued studies of neurturin, they have shown that blocking  neurturin reduces innervations and disrupts duct formation; that neurturin up-regulates vasoactive intestinal peptide  (VIP) by nerves; and that neuronal VIP regulates multiple  steps during duct development. They also are screening  for genes that are changed  in the absence of nerves and are studying the importance  of SOX2 in human tissue and organ development. In addition  to these studies of how nerves regulate  progenitor cell maintenance and morphogenic processes, Dr. Knox and colleagues are newly focusing  on understanding the contribution of progenitor cells (e.g., SOX2) and neuronal  signals to regeneration of adult organs during homeostasis and after injury.</p>
<p>Dr. Knox noted that her current  work on neuronal  control of salivary  progenitors during development and regeneration is supported by an RO1. She said that her research  continues to benefit from daily interactions in multiple clinics  at UCSF and monthly meetings  with clinicians.</p>
<p>Discussion </p>

<p>The Council  commended Dr. Butali  and Dr. Knox on their presentations and research and asked them to comment  on how the K99/ROO program could be improved. Dr. Butali and Dr. Knox both applauded  the K99 phase for providing  positive, immense, and proactive support. With respect  to the ROO phase, Dr. Butali suggested  that the NIDCR might help assure that institutional program directors honor the 25 percent specialty/clinical training time allotted  for dentist scientist  awardees, and Dr. Knox noted that more mentoring and networking support  is needed to help awardees<br/>
  identify  and decide &quot;where to go next&quot; in their transition  to other institutions.</p>

<p><strong>VI. PRECISION MEDICINE INITIATIVE</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Eric Green, Director,  National Human Genome Research Institute  (NHGRI), NIH, described  the background, vision,  and planning for the U.S. Precision Medicine  Initiative, which President Obama formally launched  on January 30, 2015. He noted that the concept of precision medicine  (i.e., medical care based on individual genetic,  environment, and lifestyle characteristics) reflects  the President&#39;s longstanding interest in genomics  and builds on the National  Research Council&#39;s 2011 report, <em>Toward Precision Medicine: Building  a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy  of Disease </em>(The  National Academies Press).</p>
<p>Dr. Green stated that the President  began to explore  the possibility of a broad genomics initiative  in spring 2014 in discussion  with Dr. Francis Collins, Director,  NIH, Dr. Eric Lander, Co-Chair,  President&#39;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST),  and White House staff. In early October, these leaders presented  an informal plan and budget for precision medicine to the President, and on January 20, the President announced the initiative in his State&#160;of the Union address to Congress, receiving applause from both parties. Dr. Green noted that on January 28, when Secretary of Health and Human Services  (HHS) Sylvia Mathews  Burwell came to the NIH for a &quot;town hall&quot; meeting, she stated that precision  medicine is a Presidential priority. He emphasized that the President  views the initiative  as part of his legacy and wants it to be rigorous,  multidisciplinary, and audacious.</p>
<p>Addressing the vision for the initiative, Dr. Green referred  the Council to a  perspective article entitled  &quot;A New Initiative on Precision Medicine,&quot; co-authored by Dr. Collins and Dr. Harold Varmus, as former director  of the National Cancer Institute  (NCI), and published online by the <em>New England  Journal of Medicine  (NEJM) </em>on January  30, 2015 (<a href="/AboutUs/Councils/NADCRC/Minutes/Pages/www.NEJM.org" target="_blank">www.NEJM.org</a>). He noted that in the near term, cancer, a ready-to-go opportunity and model for precision medicine,&#160; is the &quot;leading edge&quot; of the initiative, and in the longer term, the model will be expanded to other diseases. The aim is to create a national  research cohort of more than 1 million  volunteer individuals who will contribute to a knowledge base for precision  medicine. Dr. Green noted that barriers  to clinical participation are being addressed and that Federal  rules and regulatory  frameworks will be updated  with oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). He referred  the Council to a perspective article by Dr. Lander addressing the changes needed in<br/>
regulatory frameworks (see &quot;Cutting the Gordian Helix—Regulating Genomic  Testing in the Era ofPrecision &#160;Medicine,&quot; published &#160;online by the<em> NEJM </em>on February 17, 2015, <a href="/AboutUs/Councils/NADCRC/Minutes/Pages/www.NEJM.org" target="_blank"> www.NEJM.org</a>).</p>
<p>Dr. Green reported that the proposed  budget for the Precision Medicine  Initiative begins with $215 million  in FY 2016. This first-year appropriation will be allocated  among the NIH ($200 million),  the FDA ($10 million), and the Office of the  National Coordinator for Health Information Technology ($5 million). And, the NCI will administer the cancer component  for the NIH. Dr.  Green said that while no formal plan is in place yet, many planning  activities are under way. A first, major step will be recruitment of the national  research cohort of volunteer participants, from existing and newly recruited  cohorts, who will share their genomics data, lifestyle characteristics, biological samples, and electronic health records (ERRs). Dr. Green noted that the initiative will forge a new model for doing science—one that is founded  on research-client partnerships, open and responsive data sharing, and strong privacy protections. By using EHR data for research, the entire health care system will be converted into a &quot;learning system.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Green commented that &quot;everything old is new again,&quot; for in 2004, Dr. Collins  had envisaged development of a national  cohort for studying  gene—environment interactions (see the insight commentary entitled  &quot;The Case for a  U.S. Prospective Cohort Study of Genes and Environment,&quot; published  in <em>Nature </em>429:475-477, 27 May 2004). He noted that although this idea was ahead of its time then, the momentum for it has accelerated with advances in genomics (e.g., dramatically decreased  costs of gene sequencing), expanded  use of EHRs (now in 95 percent of health care settings), new technological opportunities (e.g., wearable sensors,  smartphones), the transformation of biomedical research by data science,  and the expressed interest of Americans in participating and partnering in research (e.g., citizen science  movements).</p>
<p>Dr. Green said that the NIH is currently  exploring ways to develop the national cohort  and has set forth an aggressive  timeline of next steps,  which move forward from the NIH kickoff  event, the Public Workshop on Building a Precision Medicine Research Cohort,  which was held at the NIH  on February 11-12, 2015, and was widely viewed on videocast. He noted that additional  meetings and workshops, which will be webcast and video-archived, will be held this summer and that the Advisory  Committee to the Director&#39;s Working  Group on the Precision Medicine  Initiative will deliver  an interim report on the cohort in September 2015. Dr.  Green said that, in coordination with the White House and other U.S. Government agencies,  the NIH anticipates announcing specific  funding opportunities in fall 2015, with initial awards  to be made in October 2016. Trans-NIH collaboration and funding may also be possible through  the NIH Common Fund and Big Data to Knowledge  (BD2K) initiative. In addition,  there will be opportunities for private-sector participation and partnership with government (e.g., with Apple Inc.) Dr. Green emphasized that transparency will be assured throughout as all activities  and events, and all requests  for information, will be posted on the NIH website  for the initiative (<a href="http://www.nih.gov/precisionmedicine)" target="_blank">www.nih.gov/precisionmedicine)</a>.</p>
<p>In closing,  Dr. Green commented  that precision medicine  is &quot;all the rage&quot; in the media and while much is not known, it is the &quot;right thing&quot; to do. He noted that the NIH leadership is comfortable with the uncertainty surrounding the initiative  thus far, for it was in the same situation  25 years ago, in 1990, when the Human Genome Project was launched.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>

<p>In response  to the Council&#39;s questions about the national  cohort, Dr. Green said that establishing a cohort that is representative of the U.S. population is a high priority and that inclusion  of children is being actively  discussed. He also noted that the NIH will draw on the expertise  and experience of patient advocacy  groups, particularly with respect to rare diseases,  and anticipates sharing  data with international data banks such as the UK Biobank.</p>
<p>Dr. Somerman  commented on the continuing struggle  to include dental health records  in medical EHRs. She suggested that the Precision  Medicine Initiative could be viewed as an opportunity to overcome the existing barriers  and to galvanize the change that is needed.</p>

<p><strong>PRECISION &#160;ORAL HEALTH  RESEARCH AT NIDCR</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Somerman  reported on NIDCR  efforts to advance precision oral health care through research. She presented an overview of precision medicine  in the NIDCR extramural portfolio and NIDCR &#160;Strategic Plan: 2014-2019, examples  of NIDCR-supported precision health  research, and a list of NIDCR-supported cohort studies and multi-institute collaborations that could contribute  to the national research cohort  envisaged for the Precision Medicine  Initiative.</p>
<p>Dr. Somerman  noted the many different areas in the NIDCR&#39;s FY 2014 extramural portfolio that align with the President&#39;s Precision  Medicine Initiative. These include,  for example, translational genomics, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,  dental and other biomaterials, salivary  biology and immunology, developmental biology and genetics, and health disparities. She noted that Goal II of the NIDCR Strategic Plan is to &quot;enable precise  and personalized oral health care through research.&quot; Dr. Somerman commented on the different  terms used for precision medicine  (e.g., personalized or individualized medicine, genomic medicine) and said that they all refer to precision health care, &quot;an emerging approach  for disease prevention  and treatment that takes into account people&#39;s  individual variations in genes, environment, and lifestyle.&quot; Dr. Somermati noted that the NIH already facilitates this research through its NIH Genomic  Data Sharing policy,  which was issued  in final fonn in 2014 and serves both to accelerate translation of data into knowledge and to protect the privacy of research  participants. She further noted that at the March 2015 House Appropriations Committee Hearing on the NIH Budget, Dr. Francis Collins  stated that dental  caries and periodontal diseases would be included in the Precision  Medicine Initiative.</p>
<p>Dr. Somerman  highlighted 10 of the research opportunities in precision medicine  that the NIDCR supports. These are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The National Dental Practice-Based Research  Network. This network comprises  six regional research  centers, involves almost  5,000 practitioners who are addressing  oral health care issues that have an immediate impact  for the more than 29,000  individuals enrolled, and has collected  blood samples from all enrollees.</li>

  <li>BigMouth. This  open-access multi-institutional dental data repository  (EHRs) is funded in partnership with axiUm and, as the largest oral health research  database, contains standardized diagnostic dental data from more than 1 million patients.</li>

  <li>FaceBase and 3-dimensional craniofacial imaging. In this coordinated extramural-intramural effort, researchers are collecting genomic  and gene expression  data along with facial imagery to identify  genetic changes and evaluate genetic mechanisms of craniofacial development and disorders.</li>

  <li>GWAS of CL/P. Investigators are identifying candidate genes for CL/P, the most commonly occurring  craniofacial birth defect,  and setting the stage for translation from animal research  to human studies.</li>

  <li>Cancer biology.  NIDCR researchers are moving most rapidly toward  precision medicine in this area, focusing on head and neck cancers  and human papilloma virus (HPV)-related  oropharyngeal cancer, which accounts  for 37 percent of HPV-associated cancers.  Through stratification of patients  using genetic-based methods,  the goal is to combine  targeted therapy with companion  diagnostic tests for all cancers.</li>
  <li>Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs). Three  specific NIDCR initiatives for research on TMDs, which are associated with severe orofacial  pain, are: Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation  and Risk Assessment (OPPERA); an upcoming clinical  trial to determine whether a genetic variation modifies  patients&#39; response to the beta-blocker propranolol; and studies  of the pharmacogenomics of orofacial pain management.</li>
  <li>Advances in salivary  diagnostics. The research advances,  which include tests that are already on the market,  non-invasive brush biopsy,  and tissue arrays,  have strong potential
applicability for diagnosis and treatment of periodontal disease,  caries, cancer, heart disease, Sjögren&#39;s  syndrome, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</li>

  <li>The oral microbiome. This area is one of five selected for the Trans-NIH Human Microbiome Project. The research, which is generating  a huge amount of information important for targeted diagnosis and treatment, includes  development of the Human Oral Microbiome Database  and definition of difficult-to-cultivate bacterial  communities.</li>
  <li>Genetics of dental  caries. Research is focused on several genes that have a potential biologic role in caries and on the effects of enamel matrix  genes on caries,  as moderated by fluoride exposure.</li>
  <li>Precision periodontal research. The aim is to ascertain biomarkers of periodontal disease progression and to identify  early markers of aggressive periodontitis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dr. Somerman  cited four cohort and collaborative studies which are funded by the NIDCR and offer significant opportunities for research collaboration and integration in the President&#39;s Precision Medicine Initiative. These  are:</p>
<ul>
<li>OPPERA, in which researchers are (a) monitoring the development of TMD and (b) determining genetic  risk factors for TMD in a cohort of more than 2,700 healthy men and women.</li>

  <li>COHRA I and II: Center for Oral Health Research  in Appalachia, in which researchers are (a) analyzing  psychosocial, genetic, and microbial risks for childhood  caries and (b) identifying factors underlying oral health disparities in a cohort of pregnant  women.</li>
  <li>The Iowa Bone Development Study, in which scientists are (a) studying  the effects of diet, physical  activity, and fluoride  exposure on bone development and (b) identifying genes involved in bone mineralization, matrix structure, and growth in a cohort of children  from birth through  adolescence.</li>
  <li>The Pediatric HIV/AIDS  Cohort Study (PHACS),  a multi-institute-funded effort in which investigators are studying (a) the effects  of perinatal HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy  on growth, development, and maturation of children and (b) the genetics and epigenetics of HIV infection and treatment in a cohort of children  and adolescents.</li>
</ul>
    <p>In closing,  Dr. Somerman commented  on the enthusiasm for precision  medicine, as well as precision  dentistry, and remarked  that it is &quot;an incredibly exciting time to be in research and practice.&quot;</p>
