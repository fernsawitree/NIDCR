<p>In 1933, a radiologist named William A. Jones  coined the term cherubism to describe a rare inflammatory bone condition of the  jaw after he observed three members of a family with swollen cheeks and  upturned eyes. In 2001, Yasuyoshi Ueki, MD, PhD, then at the Harvard School of  Dental Medicine, and colleagues determined that mutations in the <em>SH3BP2</em> (SH3-domain binding protein 2) gene  caused cherubism. Because of this discovery, doctors today can test for mutations  in the <em>SH3BP2</em> gene to confirm their  suspicion that a child has this rare condition. </p>
<p>But, unfortunately, doctors can’t do much  else for these children beyond a precise diagnosis. No therapy has been  established for cherubism, and doctors don’t operate on children with mild  forms of cherubism because much of the time, the condition—after appearing  suddenly in early childhood between the ages of about 2 and 5 years—spontaneously  resolves in adolescence. </p>
<p>Some children, however, contend with severe  effects. Children with severe facial swelling or jawbone destruction may have  bulging eyes, trouble breathing through the nose, or missing or displaced teeth.  Children with such severe effects may require surgery to improve their ability  to see, breathe, or eat. In these cases, surgeons are not curing the disease  but rather helping these children manage everyday activities that other  children take for granted.</p>
<p>Ueki, who is now an associate professor at  the University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Dentistry, continues to study  cherubism in the lab. He recently published three journal articles detailing  his ongoing research on cherubism and the functions of SH3BP2, and his most  recent projects could someday lead to the development of prevention and treatment  strategies for people with the condition.</p>
<p><strong>A possible  method of </strong><strong>preventing jawbone  destruction</strong></p>

<p>For their experiments in the research lab, Ueki’s  team genetically modified mice so that they would have the signs of  inflammation that mirror the human version of cherubism. Inflammation was  evident in the soft tissues of genetically modified mice as early as 2 weeks of  age. The inflammation progressively worsened at 3 weeks and 7 weeks.</p>

<p>Because inflammatory conditions are generally  associated with an elevated level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in  tissues, Ueki treated mice having the SH3BP2 mutations with a drug that blocks TNF-alpha function. </p>
<p>TNF-alpha-blocking drugs have already proved  helpful to people with rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions  that are more common than cherubism. For example, the drug known as etanercept relieves  the symptoms of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis by  blocking TNF-alpha function.</p>
<p>Twice a week for seven weeks, Ueki’s team injected  etanercept under the skin of one-week-old genetically modified mice. Control  mice were injected with a solution that did not contain the drug. The  researchers reported in the May 2014 issue of the <em>Journal of Bone and Mineral Research</em> that the drug prevented facial  skin inflammation and reduced the total area of bone erosion from the jaws of  genetically modified mice. When the researchers stopped injecting the drug after  seven weeks, the young mice developed facial skin inflammation and jawbone  destruction. </p>
<p>With this TNF-alpha-blocking approach, timing  is everything. As expected, the drug did not reduce inflammation in 10-week-old  genetically modified mice that already had signs of active inflammation. </p>
<p>Ueki’s studies with mice demonstrated three  things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Etanercept can prevent facial swelling and  jawbone destruction in young mice.</li>
  <li>The TNF-blocking drug needs to be given continuously  to prevent facial swelling and jawbone destruction. </li>
  <li>Etanercept does not help mice that already  have facial swelling and jawbone destruction.&#160; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A possible treatment  approach</strong></p>
<div style="width: 200px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;"><img src="/research/ResearchResults/ScienceBriefs/2015/february/PublishingImages/teethandgum.jpg" width="180" alt="Preclinical drug development: Potential treatments are usually developed in the lab before they are tested in people" style="padding-bottom: 3px;"/><br/><img width="180" src="/research/ResearchResults/ScienceBriefs/2015/february/PublishingImages/WTtoKI.jpg" alt="WT to KI" style="padding-bottom: 6px;"/><p style="font-size: 11px; padding-left: 12px;">The micro-CT scans show teeth and jawbone. Without treatment (top&#160;scan), the mice with cherubism had inflammatory bone loss (seen as shadowy pits along the jawbone). With bone marrow transplantation (bottom&#160;scan), the mice with cherubism had reduced inflammatory bone loss (no obvious pits). </p></div>

<p>Because blocking TNF-alpha with etanercept  didn’t help genetically modified mice that already had signs of cherubism,  Ueki’s team devised another approach for those mice. In the February 2015 issue  of <em>Bone</em>, they reported that mice with signs of cherubism were  helped by transplantation of bone marrow from healthy donor mice. The treatment  reduced inflammation and inflammatory bone loss.</p>





<p>Bone  marrow transplantation is an established therapy for people with certain  cancers, such as leukemia (cancer of the blood and bone marrow). Because cancer  treatments kill the healthy blood cells along with the cancer cells, doctors  give some people with leukemia an infusion of healthy bone marrow cells from a  donor. The donor’s healthy bone marrow cells help the person with leukemia  reestablish a continuous supply of healthy cells in the body.</p>
<p>Before  transplanting bone marrow from healthy donor mice into genetically modified  mice, Ueki’s team treated the genetically modified mice with a cancer drug that  kills unhealthy cells in the bone marrow. For the genetically modified mice  with developing inflammation (6 weeks old) and fully established inflammation  (10 weeks old), bone marrow transplantation worked. The treatment reduced  inflammation, facial swelling, and progressive bone loss. </p>

<p><strong>Another  possible treatment approach</strong></p>
<p>Ueki’s team has designed experiments to  systematically explore and resolve questions surrounding the development,  progression, and spontaneous regression of cherubism-related inflammation and  bone loss. In September 2014 in <em>Cell  Reports</em>, they published findings that may explain why children with  cherubism show signs suddenly between the ages of 2 and 5 years and why the  swollen cheeks and other signs tend to resolve during puberty. </p>
<p>Using lab mice, they traced the molecular  pathways for development of cherubism and described possible triggers. One  trigger could be bacteria found in dental plaque. They hypothesized that  interventions in toddlers to reduce oral bacteria could in turn reduce or delay  the signs of cherubism. However, germ-free genetically modified mice still  developed signs of cherubism so control of bacteria in the mouth alone would  not be sufficient to prevent the development of the condition.</p>
<p>They also hypothesized that a drug that  inhibits the activity of a protein known as SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) might  block the pathway that leads to the inflammation associated with cherubism. The  results of their experiments suggested that mutations in SH3BP2 activated a  pathway in certain immune cells in response to bacteria, such as those found in  dental plaque. They showed that SYK is part of the pathway that leads to  TNF-alpha production, and blocking the activity of SYK in those immune cells  could prevent inflammation. </p>
<p>Clinical trials have been conducted with  investigational drugs that inhibit the activity of SYK in people with common  diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and other diseases, but not yet  for people with cherubism. Preclinical researchers like Ueki rely on clinical  collaborators to translate their scientific findings into therapeutic  approaches for people.</p>
<p><strong>Applications beyond the rare condition</strong></p>
<p>Because Ueki  has discovered that cherubism shares molecular pathways with more common  inflammatory diseases, the approaches he’s developing for a rare condition may  find applications in the treatment of much more common diseases.
