<p><strong>ACTIVITIES OF THE NIDCR DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR <br/></strong></p>
<p>Since the last meeting of the National Advisory Dental and Craniofacial Research Council (NADCRC) in September, NIDCR Director Martha J. Somerman, DDS, PhD, has delivered lectures and presentations to numerous stakeholders and has attended meetings and symposia with several working groups and professional organizations. In addition, Dr. Somerman continued to play an active role in pain-related activities, such as serving as an NIH representative on the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee.<br/><br/>After the announcement in September that Deputy Director Isabel Garcia, DDS, MPH, will become the dean of the University of Florida College of Dentistry in February 2015, Dr. Somerman selected John Kusiak, PhD, as Senior Advisor to the Director to assist her while a new deputy director is recruited. Previously, Dr. Kusiak was acting chief of NIDCR’s Integrative Biology and Infectious Diseases Branch. Dr. Kusiak joined NIDCR in 2003 and is an exceptional scientist and administrator. In addition to leading the Integrative Biology and Infectious Diseases Branch, he is also the program officer for the Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience Program, which focuses on the pathogenesis of pain. Before joining NIDCR, he was with the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke and the National Institute of Aging. He received his PhD in biochemistry from George Washington University Medical School. <br/><br/>In January, Dr. Somerman, other NIH staff, and special guests attended a retirement event for Dr. Garcia to show appreciation for her uncompromising commitment to public health and for her exceptional judgment as a leader and to reflect on her many accomplishments since joining NIDCR in 1995. Dr. Garcia was appointed NIDCR’s deputy director in 2007. From 2010 to 2011, she served as acting director of NIDCR.&#160;</p>

<p>Dr. Somerman gave a presentation about NIDCR to the Northern Virginia Dental Society at their executive meeting in September in Tysons Corner, Virginia. The Society is a regional component of the Virginia Dental Association, which in turn is a member of the American Dental Association. Dr. Somerman was joined by Dave Vannier, PhD, a consultant with NIDCR’s Office of Communications and Health Education. <br/><br/>Dr. Somerman’s presentation focused on the mission of NIDCR, ongoing research efforts, and the short- and long-term impact of research findings on clinical practice. She emphasized the importance of establishing a bidrectional knowledge exchange between clinicians and basic scientists so that insights regarding biological mechanisms and disease processes inform and spur new clinical interventions and, conversely, so that clinical observations about the nature and progression of disease stimulate new basic investigations.&#160;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2nd Annual National Dental Practice-based Research Network Meeting</strong></span><br/><br/>In September, Dr. Somerman, Dr. Lillian Shum, director of NIDCR’s Division of Extramural Research, Dr. Donald Denucci, director of NIDCR’s Dental PBRN Program, and Dr. Dena Fischer, director of NIDCR’s Clinical Research and Epidemiology Program, attended the third annual meeting of the National Dental Practice-based Research Network in Rochester, NY.&#160; <br/></p>
<p>On the first day, the meeting included NIDCR staff, PBRN regional directors and deputy directors, regional coordinators, executive committee staff, Westat coordinating center project staff, and University of Alabama at Birmingham central administrative staff. The purpose was to discuss reports from the regional directors and committee chairs. Updates were provided about program and performance planning, study ideas, collaborations with other organizations, and status of network plans.<br/><br/>On the second day, an executive committee meeting was held, which included EC attendees and NIDCR program officers. Topics of discussion included review of the previous year’s activities and an overview of the upcoming year. Concurrently, there was a joint steering committee/regional coordinator meeting. NIDCR staff met with the regional staff as well as University of Rochester faculty and administration and University of Rochester research collaborators.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><strong>Schulich Dentistry’s Annual Research Day at Western University</strong></span></span><br/><br/>On October 7, Dr. Somerman delivered the 2014 John T. Hamilton Lecture, which is the centerpiece of Schulich Dentistry’s Annual Research Day at Western University, in London, Ontario, Canada. The lecture was attended by dental school students, faculty, and other members of the Western University community. In addition to providing an overview of NIDCR and NIH funding mechanisms and research directions, Dr. Somerman discussed her laboratory’s research on defining the key regulators controlling development, homeostasis, and regeneration of periodontal tissues.</p>
<p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Columbia University Visiting Professor Program</strong><br/><br/>Columbia University College of Dental Medicine honored Dr. Somerman by selecting her as their 2014 Visiting Professor. Launched in 1980, the Columbia Visiting Professorship Program selects a Visiting Professor each year based on nominations from an advisory committee. The committee chair is Dr. Ralph Kaslick, professor and dean emeritus at Fairleigh Dickinson University, and other committee members include Columbia faculty, alumni, and private industry representatives.&#160; <br/><br/>On October 29, Dr. Somerman delivered two lectures on personalized medicine. She emphasized that enabling personalized oral health care through research advances is one of the four areas of focus in NIDCR’s 2014-2019 Strategic Plan. Her first lecture was targeted to dental students and faculty and was titled “Enabling Precision Medicine through Research: Implications and Challenges for NIDCR.”&#160; Her second lecture had a larger audience that included alumni as well. She spoke about “Advancing Personalized Oral Healthcare: Gaps and Opportunities for NIDCR.”<br/><br style="text-decoration: underline;"/><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">American Dental Association</strong><br/><br/>On December 17, Dr. Somerman met with American Dental Association (ADA) Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer Dr. Kathleen O’Loughlin, ADA Senior Vice President of Professional Affairs Dr. Daniel Meyer, and American Dental Association Foundation Executive Director Gene Wurth on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. Other NIDCR representatives who took part in the meeting included Dr. Garcia, Dr. Kusiak, and Dr. Jane Atkinson, chief of NIDCR’s Center for Clinical Research.<br/><br/><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Funders Oral Health Policy Group – Washington, DC</strong><br/><br/>On January 8, Dr. Somerman spoke at a meeting of the Funders Oral Health Policy Group at The Pew Charitable Trusts offices in Washington, DC.&#160; The policy group includes nearly two dozen representatives from state- and national-level philanthropies that invest in oral health research and policy issues. Dr. Somerman took part in a panel titled, “Dental Innovations on the Horizon.” She described areas of oral health research that have the potential to impact dental care providers, consumers, and payers.<br/><br style="text-decoration: underline;"/><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rutgers School of Dental Medicine</span> </strong><br/><br/>On January 13, Dr. Somerman discussed NIDCR’s research goals and recent NIDCR-supported scientific advances at Rutgers School of Dental Medicine (RSDM) in Newark, New Jersey.
