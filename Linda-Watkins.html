Dr. Watkins is a University of Colorado President&#39;s Teaching Scholar and the Director of the Interdepartmental Neuroscience PhD Program. Her research is focused on how to control chronic pain and increase the effectiveness of analgesics while minimizing their side effects. When non-neuronal cells known as glia are activated, they can create persistent, amplified neuroinflammation, thereby promoting the transition from acute to chronic pain. Dr. Watkins’ work has shown that glial activation can also compromise the ability of opioids to suppress chronic pain, contributing to the development of drug tolerance and dependence. <br/><br/>Her findings have advanced our understanding of how therapeutics that target a specific glial activation receptor are effective stand-alone treatments for chronic pain and can also increase the efficacy of opioids while decreasing analgesic tolerance and dependence. Two such drugs, developed in the Watkins lab, are moving toward clinical trials.<br/><br/>She earned her doctorate in physiology and received postdoctoral training at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, Va. At the University of California Davis, she pursued postdoctoral training and was an Adjunct Lecturer and Assistant Research Neurophysiologist. Dr. Watkins then joined the University of Colorado at Boulder as a Research Associate and later became part of the faculty.<br/><br/>Dr. Watkins has held several research grants from the National Institutes of Health, including the NIDCR, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and National Institute on Drug Abuse. She has coauthored nearly 50 scientific book chapters, more than 50 peer-reviewed review articles, and more than 300 peer-reviewed research articles.<br/><br/>Her numerous awards include the Pioneer in Pain Award from the Western Pain Society, Portland, OR, in 2012; Inventor of the Year from the University of Colorado-Boulder Technology Transfer Office in 2011; Prince of Asturias Award for Technical &amp; Scientific Research from the Prince of Asturias Foundation in Spain in 2010; John Liebeskind Pain Management Research Award from the American Academy of Pain Management in 2010; and the Clinical Science Award &amp; Lectureship from the Karolinska Institute &amp; Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden in 2007.<br/><br/><strong class="ms-rteFontSize-3">When</strong><br/><br/>Monday, May 4, 2015, at 2:00 pm<br/><br/><strong class="ms-rteFontSize-3">Where</strong><br/><br/>Lipsett Amphitheater, NIH Building 10, Bethesda, Md.<br/><br/><strong class="ms-rteFontSize-3">Lecture Abstract</strong><br/><br/>Work over the past 25 years has challenged classical views of pain and opioid actions as being mediated solely by neurons. Glia (microglia &amp; astrocytes) in the trigeminal nuclei and spinal cord are key players in chronic pain, compromising the efficacy of opioids for suppressing pain, contributing to opioid tolerance and dependence/withdrawal, and potently contributing to the rewarding effects of opioids. Further, glial reactivity can be “primed” to create enduring, amplified neuroinflammation, thereby contributing to the transition of acute-to-chronic pain. Intriguingly, the glial activation receptor that creates neuroinflammation under conditions of chronic pain is the same glial receptor that is activated by opioids. Importantly, this glial activation receptor is not the neuronal opioid receptor that suppresses pain. Indeed, clinically relevant therapeutics targeting this glial activation receptor in particular, or glially driven neuroinflammation more generally, have shown remarkable efficacy as stand-alone treatments for neuropathic pain, improving the clinical utility of opioids and suppressing opioid reward. As such, compounds, including 2 novel, glial-targeting therapeutics that were discovered and optimized in the Watkins lab over the past 15 years, are rapidly moving toward clinical trials, translation of laboratory findings to humans is impending.<br/><br/><strong class="ms-rteFontSize-3">Background</strong><br/><br/><div style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; width: 180px;"><img width="170" alt="Seymour Kreshover, DDS, MD, PhD" src="/NewsAndFeatures/Announcements/PublishingImages/Seymour_Kreshover.jpg" style="padding-bottom: 4px;"/><br/><p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: center;"><strong>Seymour Kreshover, DDS, MD, PhD, director

NIDCR established the NIDCR Seymour J. Kreshover Lecture as a tribute to the late Seymour Kreshover, DDS, MD, PhD, who served as director of the (then) National Institute of Dental Research from 1966–1975. Lectures are delivered by outstanding investigators who have made significant contributions to research that impacts the dental, oral, and craniofacial field. With the 2015 Kreshover Lecture, NIDCR is reprising the series, which was last delivered in 2005.<br/><br/>The Lecture is free and open to the public. Sign language interpreters will be provided.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
