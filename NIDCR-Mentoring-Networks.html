<p><strong>Research Training and Career Development Branch<br>Division of Extramural Activities</strong></p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE </strong><br>
The goal of this initiative is to enhance the research career progression and success of postdoctoral  fellows and junior faculty who  are  currently underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences. This goal will be addressed through the development of mentoring networks that will facilitate  interactions between experienced investigators/mentors and these early career stage investigators, and will provide structured and unstructured activities to enhance  their professional skills  and abilities in pursuing dental, oral, and craniofacial research careers.</p>
<p>Expected outcomes for the early career stage investigators participating in  mentoring networks include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Success in transitioning to a subsequent career stage, such as a postdoctoral fellow achieving a  junior faculty position, a junior/clinical investigator achieving a tenure-track position, and junior  faculty investigator achieving tenure; authorship of scientific  publications, and/or  subsequent  independent research  grant  support from NIH or other  source.</li>

  <li>Continued participation in scientific  research careers as independent  investigators and members of  the dental, oral, and craniofacial research  community.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mentoring network will establish processes and provide activities to ensure robust and high quality  mentorship and the advancement of the participants&rsquo; professional goals  towards independent dental, oral, and craniofacial research careers. Mentoring activities may include: providing technical expertise,  advice, insight into developing a research  career; facilitating scholarly writing and grantsmanship;Â  promoting successful transitions from one  career stage to another; providing leadership development;  helping to identify potential collaborators; and helping to establish interdisciplinary or  translational  collaborations to foster research  career independence.  As a result of these  experiences, the participants are expected to achieve professional career  advancement and independent research  funding. These  achievements will lead  to the enhanced diversification of the community of independent investigators in the dental, oral, and craniofacial research workforce and an increased  number of skilled investigators  from underrepresented  groups in requisite scientific research areas to advance the objectives of the <a href="/research/ResearchPriorities/StrategicPlan/"> NIDCR Strategic Plan 2014&ndash;2019</a>.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND </strong><br>
Fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key  component of the NIH strategy to identify, develop, support and maintain the quality of our scientific  human capital (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-053.html" target="_blank">NOT-OD-15-053</a>). NIH recognizes that  achieving diversity in the biomedical research  workforce is critical to the full realization of our national  research goals and is  in the best  interest of our  country. Although the NIH currently provides multiple opportunities to develop research careers and  improve participation for individuals from groups underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences, a recent report from the NIH Director&rsquo;s Working Group on Diversity of the Biomedic al  Research Workforce (WGDBRW) provides evidence that achieving diversity in the biomedical research workforce remains an important problem that must be actively addressed (see <a href="http://acd.od.nih.gov/dbr.htm" target="_blank">http://acd.od.nih.gov/dbr.htm</a>).</p>

  <p>This report examined  five key transition points in the biomedical research career pipeline: (i) entry  into graduate degree programs; (ii) the transition from graduate degree to postdoctoral fellowship; (iii)  the appointment from a  postdoctoral position to the first independent  scientific position; (iv) the award of the  first independent  research grant from NIH or  equivalent  in a non-academic setting;  and (v) award of tenure  in an academic position or equivalent  in a non-academic  setting.</p>
  <p>Mentoring/career preparation and retention was identified as a high priority. One recommendation suggested that NIH should partner with  established minority scientific  and  professional groups and other organizations to implement a system of mentorship &ldquo;networks&rdquo; for underrepresented minority students  that will provide career  guidance throughout their  career development.  The networks would be expected to make available  a cadre of  experienced investigators who would help shape  a junior investigator&rsquo;s  research ideas and formulate a compelling grant proposal, and provide  workshops to increase  professional skills  in support of research  career development, including the  NIH  grant process. The  committee&rsquo;s full recommendations and  comprehensive strategy to increase the  diversity of  the biomedical  research workforce are  included  in the report  (<a href="http://acd.od.nih.gov/dbr.htm" target="_blank">http://acd.od.nih.gov/dbr.htm</a>).</p>
  <p>The NIDCR Mentoring Networks for Underrepresented Postdoctoral and Early-Career Faculty Investigators  initiative is intended for individuals at the  key transition points iii and iv, and addresses the  recommendations in the area  of mentoring/career preparation and retention.</p>
  <p><strong>Enhancing Diversity in the Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Workforce </strong></p>
  
  <p>Objective 4-3 of the <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-12-149.html" target="_blank">NIDCR Strategic Plan 2014&ndash;2019</a> is to support research, training,  and career development  programs  that  value team science, transformative  approaches, and diversity  at all levels. The proposed program will  dovetail with  NIH  wide efforts to enhance diversity in the NIH biomedical research  workforce, while providing a unique emphasis  on mentorship for  individuals pursuing careers  in dental,  oral, and craniofacial  research. Currently, NIDCR participates in  two diversity targeted programs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-14-148.html" target="_blank">Ruth L.  Kirschstein National Research Service Awards for Individual Predoctoral Fellowships to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (F31- Diversity)</a>. This program is an individual predoctoral fellowship for PhD students who meet NIH criteria  for  groups underrepresented in biomedical  research </li>
    <li><a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-15-322.html" target="_blank">Research Supplements  to  Promote Diversity  in Health-Related Research</a>. This program provides  research training experiences for  individuals who meet  NIH  criteria for groups underrepresented in  biomedical research. Career  levels supported include high school  to  junior faculty levels. <em>In fiscal  years 2012-2015, NIDCR  supported 20 individuals  at the postdoctoral and junior faculty levels on research supplements  to support diversity in  biomedical  research.</em></li></ul>
  <p>Both of these programs involve an individualized mentored research training and career development experience. The proposed NIDCR Mentorship Network will complement these existing programs  through  its focus on cohorts of individuals at  the career transition point between postdoctoral fellow/junior  faculty member and independent  investigator, and its intent to foster success in this  transition. In addition,  the NIDCR Mentorship Network  is expected to lead to the development of a nationwide  network of dental,  oral, and craniofacial  research mentors  and participants that can augment  individual research training and career development experiences.</p>
