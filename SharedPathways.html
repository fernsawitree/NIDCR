<p><strong><em>Innovative  studies of cherubism may aid development of therapies for common inflammatory  bone diseases</em></strong></p>

<p>Yasuyoshi Ueki, MD, PhD, an associate professor  at the University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Dentistry, studies the  functions of <em>SH3BP2 </em>(SH3-domain  binding protein 2) gene. In 2001, he revealed that mutations in the <em>SH3BP2</em> gene were the cause of <a href="/research/ResearchResults/ScienceBriefs/2015/february/Pages/Changing-the-Face-of-Cherubism.aspx">cherubism,  a rare inflammatory bone condition of the jaw.</a> Since that time, he and his research team  have been investigating the mechanisms that are involved in the inflammation  and bone loss associated with cherubism. </p>
<p>His team&rsquo;s recent exploration and  identification of certain molecular pathways involved in bone loss suggest that  SH3BP2 might be a potential therapeutic target for other inflammatory diseases,  such as rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, and lupus. Whereas cherubism is  very rare and is limited to facial bones, rheumatoid arthritis and other  inflammatory diseases impact millions of people and harm tissues throughout the  body. All of these inflammatory conditions are associated with an elevated  level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in tissues. </p>

  Because the cherubism mutation in SH3BP2  results in increased bone loss and bone destruction, the researchers  hypothesized that inhibiting SH3BP2 could prevent TNF-alpha-related  inflammatory bone loss, such as the loss that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis.  In articles recently published in <em>PLOS  One,</em> the<em> Journal of Bone and Mineral  Research, and Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology</em>,Uekidemonstrated that  suppressing SH3BP2 function could reduce TNF-alpha-related inflammation and  bone loss in inflammatory bone-destructive diseases. Ueki&rsquo;s three articles  exemplify how investigating the effects of genetic mutations that trigger a  rare disorder may shed light on molecular pathways of more common human  diseases.</p>
 
<p>Ueki thinks that SH3BP2 might be a molecular  target for developing novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis, which is a type  of autoimmune disease. &ldquo;Autoimmune arthritis is a consequence of complex immune  reactions that involve a variety of immune cells,&rdquo; explained Ueki. They hope to  reveal the cell type that contributes to the suppression of disease and to identify  the molecule that helps control the SH3BP2 pathway and function. If that work  progresses as expected, the ultimate goal is to achieve cell-specific  suppression of SH3BP2 to prevent or treat arthritis. </p>
