<p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong><br>
The goal of this initiative is to develop new prototype biosensors for noninvasive, dynamic, real-time monitoring of physiological processes in the human body using the oral cavity as the sensing site. These biosensors will be able to assess health and disease states and receive signals from oral fluids, cells and microorganisms, as well as other compounds that are found in or pass through the oral cavity. Additional capabilities of such biosensors may include communicating of outputs wirelessly and remotely, and transmitting these outputs to a data collection center or to a drug delivery device that would dynamically and flexibly dispense therapeutic compounds to tissues in accordance with the immediate physiological needs of a patient.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND </strong><br>
Prevention and early disease detection are key components of maintaining health.  In this  regard, the  ability to have dynamic  real-time surveillance and diagnostic  information of physiology would have a significant impact.  The  development of miniature, flexible, and wireless  biosensors  will provide the  opportunity to utilize the oral  cavity as a region to gather information on vital physiological, metabolic and toxicological parameters and outputs. In recent years  the  biosensor field has undergone dramatic expansion (<a href="http://rogers.matse.illinois.edu/files/2015/jamabioe.pdf" target="_blank">Rogers, 2015 (PDF - 223 KB)</a>). However, one significant hurdle for translating biosensor technologies into clinical practice has  been difficulty in finding  protected regions on the body where such devices can be  safely and easily attached, and where they can be conveniently accessed. In this respect, the oral cavity represents an ideal site as it fulfills  these criteria. Moreover, placement of  biosensors  in  the oral cavity  can  be conveniently performed by dental professionals  during routine dental office visits. Lastly, because the oral  cavity serves as  the  entryway for bacteria/viruses, medications, dietary and toxic  substances; and offers a choice of soft (cheeks),  firm (gingiva),  and  hard (teeth) surfaces for biosensor placement for short or long-term monitoring  (<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/ipdf/10.1021/ac5039863" target="_blank">Chengzhou <em>et al., </em>2014<em>, </em></a><a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/ipdf/10.1021/nl503997m" target="_blank">Hwang <em>et al</em>., 2015</a>),  it  may become a site of choice for information gathering to enable integrative precision medicine-based diagnostics (<a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n3/pdf/ncomms1767.pdf" target="_blank">Mannoor <em>et al</em>. 2012 (PDF - 807 KB)</a>).  For example, recent work demonstrates an oral  application of measuring silver and mercury in  saliva using a surface-enhanced  Raman scattering biosensor  taking  advantage of plasmonic  coupling  (<a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2015/nr/c5nr02142a" target="_blank">Zheng <em>et  al. </em>2015 (PDF - 2,981 KB)</a>). Other work has  focused on glucose biosensors using functionalized titanium oxide nanotube arrays  (<a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/141104/srep06891/pdf/srep06891.pdf" target="_blank">Gao <em>e</em><em>t al., </em>2014</a>) or surface  plasmon resonance  optical  sensors  (<a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2015/an/c4an01079e" target="_blank">Li <em>et al</em>.,  2015 (PDF - 1,950 KB)</a>).</p>
<p>Possible applications  for  dentistry would include detecting changes in the oral  flora with respect to  caries progression, monitoring the dynamics of  periodontal disease,  developing and measuring of  loading  forces during  orthodontic treatment, and correlating TMJ loading with the progression from  acute to chronic  pain in TMD. Beyond dental applications,  sensors placed in the oral  cavity can monitor  changes in the diet, levels of malnutrition, medication intake and compliance,  biomolecule turnover, among many other  potential  measureable inputs. The vision for biosensor  research  also includes integration of sensing with drug delivery in such a way that a  reading of a physiological parameter outside of  a predetermined range as detected by a  biosensor would transmit a  signal  to a  drug delivery device to dispense a  precise dose of  a therapeutic compound to restore normal tissue homeostasis. One of many possible examples of  such applications could include enabling tight glycemic control for  diabetic patients  by  monitoring  blood glucose with oral  biosensors and integrating these outputs with  insulin from a delivery pump. Another example could be initiating enamel remineralization by the release of calcium- and phosphate- containing  nanoparticles  in  response to a drop in pH, changes in  calcium and phosphate levels or an increase in the level of cariogenic  bacterial species  in  the mouth as measured by an oral biosensor.</p>
<p>These and other applications  of  oral biosensors for dynamic  and  precise real-time control of oral and systemic diseases  and  conditions, are likely to generate new therapeutic  paradigms for effective,  economical  and  low-morbidity  precision medicine approaches that will greatly benefit diverse patient  populations.</p>
<p><strong>FEASIBILITY AND TIMELINESS </strong><br>
This initiative is feasible  and timely because of recent progress in wireless technologies, dissolvable  nanotechnology-based  electronics, microfabrication technologies  and  improved sensing and  drug delivery instrumentation. The novel  biosensors  developed as  a result of these advances will enable  interactive and integrative communication between patients  and  health care providers,  and  for certain  applications will allow monitoring  and  program/reprogram treatment remotely (<a href="http://rogers.matse.illinois.edu/files/2015/jamabioe.pdf" target="_blank">Rogers, 2015 (PDF - 223 KB)</a>).  Moreover,  since the oral cavity serves as the main entryway for many inputs in the body, this  initiative  will provide NIDCR  a unique opportunity to impact both oral/dental and general health,  because these biosensors will  have the capacity to obtain, with minimal  invasive procedures, real time dynamic monitoring of oral and systemic conditions that can be integrated with dynamic and precise drug  delivery to enable precision medicine preventative and therapeutic approaches  to  improve health.</p>
<p><strong>CURRENT NIDCR/NIH PORTFOLIO </strong><br>
The NIDCR Dental Materials  Program currently supports several SBIR/STTR projects  through its &ldquo;Imaging  Diagnostics of Dental Diseases and Conditions&rdquo; FOA (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-12-193.html" target="_blank">PA12-193 </a>and <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-12-195.html" target="_blank">PA12-195</a>), which are focused on the diagnosis  of  cracks, dental caries, and measuring  pulp vitality with  hand held devices that utilize signal  inputs and feedback.  However, these devices do not employ wireless approach  and do not provide  continuous, real-time analysis.</p>
<p><strong>ALIGNMENT WITH NIDCR STRATEGIC PLAN </strong><br>
Goal 1, Objective 3: Conduct translational and clinical investigations to improve dental, oral,  and craniofacial  health<br>
  Goal 2, Objective 1: Support research toward precise classification, prevention, and treatment of dental, oral, and craniofacial health and  disease</p>
<p>NIBIB has shown interest in partnering in this  Initiative.</p>
