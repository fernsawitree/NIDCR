<h3><a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2014/od-22.htm">NIH Awards Nearly $31 million to Enhance Diversity in the Biomedical Research Workforce</a></h3>

<p>In October, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded about $31 million to develop new approaches that will engage researchers, including those from backgrounds underrepresented in biomedical sciences, and prepare them to thrive in the NIH-funded workforce. These awards are part of a projected five-year program to support more than 50 awardees and partnering institutions in establishing a national consortium to develop, implement, and evaluate approaches to encourage individuals to start and stay in biomedical research careers.</p>

<p>“These awards represent a significant step toward ensuring that NIH’s future biomedical research workforce will reflect the unique perspectives found within the diverse composition of our society,” said NIH Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity <br/>Hannah Valantine, MD.</p></div>
