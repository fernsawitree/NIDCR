<p><strong>HHS/NIH UPDATE</strong></p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NIH to Submit Strategic Plan to Congress</strong></p>

<p>In response to a request from Congress, NIH is developing a 5-year NIH-wide Strategic Plan to advance its mission of supporting biomedical research and applying that knowledge to promote health. The Strategic Plan will outline major trans-NIH themes, rather than describe important disease-specific research opportunities, which are detailed in the strategic plans of institutes and centers. NIH aims to outline unifying principles to guide NIH in pursuit of its mission. For example, the Strategic Plan will describe how NIH sets priorities and how NIH enhances stewardship of the research enterprise. The key areas of opportunity are the following: promote basic science because it is the foundation for progress; improve health promotion and disease prevention; and advance treatments and cures.</p>

<p>Senior leadership contributed to the content of the Strategic Plan, and external stakeholder input about the framework for the Plan was encouraged this summer through several public Webinars and a <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-118.html" target="_blank">Request for Information</a>.

<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Communications Update</strong></p>

<p><strong>New Communication Service: GovDelivery</strong><br />
Since the last meeting of Council, NIDCR launched GovDelivery, a service that will automate and streamline the management of the Institute&rsquo;s email distribution lists and will enable the Institute to communicate more easily with subscribers via email, text messages, and RSS feeds. More than 1,000 public sector organizations around the world use GovDelivery to communicate with their constituents. NIDCR uses GovDelivery to send e-newsletters and notices to subscribers. For example, <a href="https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNIHNIDCR/subscriber/new" target="_blank">anyone can sign up for messages from NIDCR ​</a>about Grants and Funding, NIDCR Updates, or Science News.</p>
<p>NIDCR receives reports for every email message sent through GovDelivery. The Office of Communications and Health Education is monitoring the number of subscriptions, how many messages are delivered, how many messages are opened, and how many times that links within a message are opened. Collecting and analyzing such data will help NIDCR understand which topics are most appealing to subscribers so that we can better target future communications.</p>
