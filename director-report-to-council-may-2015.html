<p><strong>HHS/NIH  UPDATE</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Public Health Service  Recommendation for Fluoride Concentration in Drinking Water</u></strong><u> </u></p>
<p>On April 27, the Department of Health and Human Services released the  final <a href="http://www.publichealthreports.org/fluorideguidelines.cfm" target="_blank">Public  Health Service recommendation</a> for the optimal fluoride level in  drinking water to prevent tooth decay. The new recommendation is for a single  level of 0.7 milligram of fluoride per liter of water. It updates and replaces  the previous recommended range, which was 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per liter,  issued in 1962. The change was recommended because Americans now have access to  more sources of fluoride, such as toothpaste and mouth rinses, than they did  when water fluoridation was first introduced in the United States. As a result,  the prevalence of fluorosis has increased, which, in most cases, manifests as  barely visible lacy white spots on the tooth enamel. The new recommended level  will maintain the protective decay prevention benefits of water fluoridation  and reduce the occurrence of dental fluorosis. </p>
<p>A federal panel reviewed the scientific evidence related to fluoride  concentration in drinking water. Members of the federal panel included Isabel  Garcia, DDS, MPH (then deputy director of NIDCR), Amit Chattopadhyay, BDS, MDS,  MPH, PhD (then epidemiologist in NIDCR/OSPA), and Timothy Iafolla, DMD, MPH, of  OSPA.&#160; </p>

</ul>
<p><strong>NIH  Grant Writing Course</strong><br/>
  The NIDCR Office of  Education continues to provide support for career development of our  postdoctoral community. Two NIDCR trainees were selected to participate in a  grant-writing course titled  “NIH Grant Writing Course - An In-Depth Workshop.” The seven-part course was led by Paula  Gregory, PhD, who is an associate professor in the Department of Genetics at  Louisiana State University. It gives participants the opportunity to write a  rough draft of an NIH grant using their own data. In addition to this workshop,  our trainees also participated in an NIH grant mock study section. For the mock  study section, trainees scored NIH grants that had been previously reviewed and  scored to learn about the key aspects of a successful application. Attendees  found these sessions extremely useful.&#160;&#160; </p>
