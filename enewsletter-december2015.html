    <h3><strong>NIDCR Director Martha Somerman, DDS, PhD, Meets with Oral Health Disparities Consortium Grantees</strong></h3>
    <p>On November 12, NIDCR Director Martha J. Somerman, DDS, PhD, met with the principal investigators from the data coordinating center and ni​ne studies that make up the <a href="/research/NIDCR_Centers_and_Research_Networks/pages/Consortium-to-Reduce-Oral-Health-Disparities.aspx">Multidisciplinary and Collaborative Research Consortium to Reduce Oral Health Disparities in Children</a>. </p>
    <p>“Having the opportunity to hear about the multilevel theoretical or conceptual framework underpinning each project and to ask questions about study design was of great value to me,” said Dr. Somerman. “With the variety of settings across the country being utilized and research questions being asked, researchers supported by NIDCR are poised to make substantial advances in reducing oral health disparities among U.S. children.”</p>
    <p>In addition to NIDCR leadership and other staff, Nathaniel Stinson, Jr., MD,&#160;PhD, the director of the Division of Scientific Programs at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, took part in the meeting and discussions.</p>

  <p>NIDCR is one of several institutes taking part in an NIH funding opportunity called “<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-AG-16-020.html" target="_blank">Impact of Aging on Currently Employed Animal Models of Disease and Chronic Conditions: Demonstration Projects</a>” (RFA-AG-16-020). The trans-NIH Geroscience Interest Group developed this opportunity for phase innovation awards under the auspices of the National Institute on Aging.</p>
  <p>“The goal of this program is to encourage investigators who are actively researching a disease in an established animal model to introduce aging into their studies,” said <a href="mailto:Leslie.Frieden@nih.gov">NIDCR Program Official Leslie A. Frieden, PhD</a>, who is the NIDCR representative to the trans-NIH Geroscience Interest Group. </p>
  <p>Applications are due January 6, 2016, for projects that can demonstrate the importance of aging on animal models of dental, oral, and craniofacial conditions. Examples of possible topics for NIDCR cooperative agreements include the following:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-position: outside;margin-left:10px;">
    <li><strong>Natural history of pain</strong>: How chronic orofacial pain progresses in an aging system. </li>
    <li><strong>Tissue regeneration</strong>: How strategies for regenerating dental, oral, and craniofacial tissue that show efficacy in younger animal models are altered in aging animals. </li>
    <li><strong>Oral disease progression</strong>: Studies of disease-related, drug-induced, and radiation-induced changes in salivary gland function in aging models.</li>

The goal of the Open Science Prize is to support the development and prototyping of services, tools, and platforms that will make scientific research data freely available to advance discovery and spur innovation. The first phase of the competition is accepting applications through February 29, 2016. Up to six teams of technology experts and researchers will win $80,000 each to develop their ideas into a prototype or to advance an existing early-stage prototype. The prototype judged to have the greatest potential to further open science will receive $230,000.</p>
