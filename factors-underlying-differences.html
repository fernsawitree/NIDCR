<p><strong>National Advisory Dental and Craniofacial Research Council</strong></p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong> <br>
The goal of this  initiative is to encourage research on mechanisms underlying male/female-based  differences in Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial  (DOC)-related diseases and conditions. Specifically,  this initiative encourages studies  aimed at understanding immune  reactivity, genetic and environmental  triggers, and hormonal  changes as they relate to male/female-based differences in DOC-related diseases and conditions including, but  not  limited to, Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s Syndrome (SS), orofacial pain, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder (TMD), and HPV-associated  oropharyngeal cancers and salivary  gland tumors.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND </strong><br>
It is now recognized that  chronic diseases affect women and men differently, and DOC  diseases and conditions,  such as SS, orofacial pain,  TMD,  salivary gland tumors, and oropharyngeal cancers are no exception. Substantial  differences, both  in presentation and in challenges  to  long-term management,  exist between males and females with these  conditions. However, critical scientific  gaps remain in our  understanding of  the underlying mechanisms of male/female-based differences in disease onset,  progression, and persistence, as well as consequences  for daily functioning,  and responses to treatment.</p>
<p>Many autoimmune  diseases, including SS,  exhibit a greater incidence rate (IR)  in females; in fact,  SS is one with the highest female  preponderance among all autoimmune diseases of about 9:1. SS is characterized by  lymphocytic infiltration of salivary and lacrimal  glands resulting in irreversible tissue  damage, causing dry mouth and dry eyes as well  as other  systemic manifestations, including an  increased risk for  non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. SS primarily affects post-menopausal women,  suggesting a  role for sex hormones in disease development. While previous  studies have  focused on  clinical differences between men and women with  SS,  to date, the mechanism of this  difference is not understood (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15229956" target="_blank">Díaz-López <em>et</em><em>a</em><em>l. </em>2004</a>). In addition, limited data  exist on the  severity of disease  in men verses women. Thus  far, genome wide  association studies  (GWAS) have focused on the presence or  absence of SS as made  by  clinical diagnosis (<a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n11/full/ng.2792.html" target="_blank">Lessard <em>et al. </em>2013</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n11/full/ng.2779.html" target="_blank">Li <em>et </em><em>a</em><em>l.</em>2013</a>). Interestingly, studies have  revealed  that men with Klinefelter  syndrome (XXY males)  develop autoimmune diseases, specifically systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  at rates similar  to  females (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.23701/abstract%3Bjsessionid%3D8DB33ECB4D7D76948E5BF98D65443EA2.f03t01" target="_blank">Scofield <em>et al. </em>2008</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2011.02185.x/abstract" target="_blank">Dillon <em>et  al. </em>2010</a>). Recent studies on X-chromosome inactivation report that at  least 10% of  the  X-chromosome escapes inactivation potentially leading to over-expression of certain gene products in  females (<a href="http://ard.bmj.com/content/69/12/2213.long" target="_blank">Broen <em>et al. </em>2010</a>). Many of the genes on the X-chromosome are involved in the immune  response. In addition to genetics,  sex hormones, environmental  factors, and infections have also been  reported to play a  role  in autoimmune disease, including SS.</p>
<p>TMD, a heterogeneous  disorder often  characterized by pain and dysfunction in the TMJ and muscles   that control  jaw movement, primarily  affects women of childbearing age  and falls off sharply with  advancing middle age. Females demonstrate 4-fold greater  odds of TMD relative to males (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Summary+of+Findings+from+the+OPPERA+Baseline+Case-Control+Study%3A+Implications+and+Future+Directions" target="_blank">Fillingim <em>et al.</em>  2011</a>) and a greater risk of  transition from acute to chronic  pain status. Earlier studies showed  that TMD pain intensity is linked to hormonal fluctuations and that estradiol can modulate facial  pain (Turner <em>et al.</em> 2011 and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1808228/pdf/nihms18070.pdf" target="_blank">Smith <em>e</em><em>t </em><em>a</em><em>l. </em>2006</a>).  Further,  data suggest that female hormones may play an important role in the development and persistence of this condition. Recent evidence from the NIDCR-supported  Orofacial Pain Prospective Evaluation and Risk  Assessment (OPPERA)  study  indicates  that  while females have significantly greater odds  of developing chronic TMD, the IR of first-onset TMD in females is only  marginally greater than in  males (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590013012613" target="_blank">Slade <em>et </em><em>a</em><em>l.</em>2013</a>). Pain hypersensitivity in male and female mice is  differentially dependent on microglia and T cells,  and implies a sex-specific response to microglia targeted  pain treatments (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26120961" target="_blank">Sorge <em>et al. </em>2015</a>)<em>. </em>The  etiology and mechanisms  of another orofacial pain  condition, burning mouth  syndrome (BMS) that disproportionately affects  postmenopausal women  remain largely unknown. Collectively, women  are greatly overrepresented  among patients with other chronic  pain conditions that  can overlap with  orofacial pain, including migraine, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue  syndrome, and interstitial  cystitis. A firm understanding of whether different  overlapping pain  conditions share mechanisms involving general central  nervous  system dysfunction, the nature of the  mechanisms behind orofacial pain conditions  affecting females <em>vs</em>.  males as well as a detailed characterization of female <em>vs. </em>male disorder-specific  symptoms, is  lacking.</p>
<p>Cancers of the oral cavity and salivary glands show disproportionate IR in men and women and the  basis of these differences are not well understood. Males have  a 51% higher combined IR  of  the major salivary gland carcinomas, but  the IR varies significantly within the  subtypes of salivary gland carcinomas. For example,  females show  25 -38% higher (age-adjusted below 50 years of age) IR of adenoid cystic, acinic  cell and muco-epidermoid carcinoma whereas men show 122% higher IR of  squamous cell carcinomas of  the  salivary gland (<a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/18/11/2899.long" target="_blank">Boukheris <em>et </em><em>a</em><em>l</em>. 2009</a>). Interestingly, HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers  are  3-5 fold more  common in men than women, which correlates only partially (~18%) with behavioral risk factors (<a href="http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/75/12/2468.full" target="_blank">Chaturvedi <em>et al. </em>2015</a>). Recent  studies indicate that males have  lower seroconversion rates upon HPV  infection compared to  females (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405852115000130" target="_blank">Giuliano <em>et al. </em>2015</a>).</p>
<p>These and other  critical advances identified a strong need to elucidate underlying mechanisms of  male/female-based differences in  DOC-related diseases and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES </strong><br>
A wealth of available information about male/female differences  in IR for a number of DOC  diseases points to the importance  of considering sex when examining the  underlying mechanisms of  disease. It  is well-established that  women demonstrate  increased immune  reactivity, increased levels  of IgM, and a stronger humoral and cellular immune  responses to antigens,  compared  to  men. Advancing our understanding of  the underlying mechanisms leading to this  skewed representation is  likely to result in  the identification of  new  therapeutic targets and lead to the  development of precision medicine-based  therapies and behavioral interventions.</p>

<p><strong>CURRENT PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW </strong><br>
Projects addressing the understanding  of  mechanisms underlying male/female-based  differences in DOC-related diseases and conditions are  underrepresented in the  NIDCR extramural research portfolio. A search of recent NIDCR research  project grants (2013&ndash;2015)  associated with  SS,  orofacial pain, TMD, HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers,  and  salivary gland tumors identified  109  projects in these areas. Of these projects  28%  were focused on SS, 39% on pain and 32% on cancer. A more focused  search, specifically targeting sex-based differences in these diseases demonstrates the need to consider this concept proposal: only 3% of  these NIDCR funded grants are actively investigating sex-based  differences. Although other  NIH  Institutes also fund research in  these general research  areas, there are a  limited number of grants currently examining sex-based  differences in DOC-related diseases and conditions across  NIH.</p>
<p>NIDCR&rsquo;s investment in both the  <u><a href="https://sicca-online.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank">Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s International  Collaborative Clinical Alliance</a></u> (SICCA) Biorepository ( &gt;3000 female samples and &gt;300 male samples are available) and the <a href="https://research.mdacc.tmc.edu/Salivary_DB/index.html" target="_blank">Salivary Gland Tumor Biorepository</a> (SGTB) provide well-characterized biological materials from  patients to help investigators design studies  to better understand mechanisms of differential  DOC diseases and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>ALIGNMENT WITH INSTITUTE GOALS AND STRATEGIC PLAN </strong><br>
This concept  aligns with the goals and objectives of <a href="http://auth.nidcr.cit.nih.gov/research/ResearchPriorities/StrategicPlan/pages/default.aspx">NIDCR Strategic Plan 2014&ndash;2019</a>: Goal I, Objective 1-1: Enable basic research to advance knowledge of dental,  oral,  and  craniofacial health; Goal 2, Objective 2-1: Support research  toward precise classification, prevention,  and treatment of dental, oral, and craniofacial health and disease.</p>
<p><strong>OVERLAPPING INTERESTS WITH OTHER NIH INSTITUTES AND CENTERS </strong><br>

Explorations as  addressed by this  initiative will stimulate interest and potential for partnerships with other  NIH  Institutes and Centers such as ORWH,  NEI, NIAID, NIAMS,  NINDS, and NCI, which share common interests with NIDCR in several diseases.</p>
