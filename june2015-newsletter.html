  <h3><strong>NIDCR Joins New Area of Biomedical Research: Electronic Cigarette Health Effects</strong></h3>
  <p>To help inform future health policy decisions,  NIDCR is working toward collecting evidence of the biological effects of  electronic cigarettes. With the release of two funding opportunities, NIDCR  will support research aimed at the possible effects on the oral cavity of aerosol  mixtures produced by electronic cigarettes. Applications for <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DE-16-004.html" target="_blank">R01</a> and <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DE-16-005.html" target="_blank">R21</a> research funding  opportunities are due on July 28.</p>
  <p>On May 15, the health effects of electronic cigarettes was the topic of  the NIDCR Clinical Research Fellowship Grand Rounds, which was held on the NIH  campus. Stanton Glantz, PhD, professor of medicine at the University of  California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine, presented a lecture called  “<a href="http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=19003&amp;bhcp=1" target="_blank">E-cigarettes: Back to the Future</a>.” Dr. Glantz is the director of the UCSF  Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education and the principal  investigator in the UCSF Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science. </p>

  <h3>HHS Releases Final Recommendation for Fluoride Concentration in Drinking Water</h3>
    
    <p>On April 27, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  released the final <a href="http://www.publichealthreports.org/fluorideguidelines.cfm" target="_blank">Public Health Service recommendation</a> <a href="http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/AboutUs/Councils/NADCRC/DirectorsReport/Directors-Report-May-2015.htm"><img border="0" width="10" height="10" src="/NewsAndFeatures/ENewsletters/CurrentNews/Pages/june2015-newsletter_clip_image001.png" alt="external link"/></a> for  the optimal fluoride level in drinking water to prevent tooth decay. The new  recommendation is for a single level of 0.7 milligram of fluoride per liter of  water. This recommendation updates and replaces the previous recommended range,  which was 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per liter, issued in 1962. </p>
    <p>HHS recommended the change in optimal fluoride concentration  because Americans now have access to more sources of fluoride, such as  toothpaste and mouth rinses, than they did when water fluoridation was first  introduced in the United States. As a result, the prevalence of fluorosis has  increased, which, in most cases, manifests as barely visible lacy white spots  on the tooth enamel. The new recommended level will maintain the protective  decay prevention benefits of water fluoridation and reduce the occurrence of  dental fluorosis. </p>
    <p>A federal panel reviewed the scientific evidence related to  fluoride concentration in drinking water. Members of the federal panel included  Isabel Garcia, DDS, MPH (then deputy director of NIDCR), Amit Chattopadhyay,  BDS, MDS, MPH, PhD (then in NIDCR’s Office of Science Policy and Analysis (OSPA)),  and Timothy Iafolla, DMD, MPH, in OSPA.&#160;</p>
