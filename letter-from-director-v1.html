<p>“<em>A lack of diversity in the  scientific workforce limits our potential for spurring innovations in dental,  oral, and craniofacial research.”</em><br/>

<p>Research shows that teams with members from  diverse backgrounds are more likely to generate innovative ideas than teams made up of members from similar backgrounds.  &#160;For NIDCR to succeed in <a href="/AboutUs/MissionandStrategicPlan/MissionStatement/">our  mission to improve dental,  oral, and craniofacial health&#160;through&#160;research and research&#160;training</a>, we must continue to recruit scientists who have  different backgrounds and life experiences. &#160;Their participation is vital to the  realization of <a href="/Research/ResearchPriorities/StrategicPlan/">NIDCR’s  Strategic Plan 2014-2019</a>.</p>

<p>NIDCR’s goal is to attract and retain a  larger proportion of people from <a href="https://diversity.nih.gov/about/populations" target="_blank">underrepresented racial and ethnic groups,  people with disabilities, and people from economically  or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds</a>. &#160;But this goal is not limited to NIDCR; enhancing diversity of  the biomedical workforce is an initiative that involves all 27 NIH institutes  and centers. On April 24, 2015, the NIDCR Committee on Diversity and  Inclusion and representatives from several other Institutes hosted “Enhancing Diversity and Inclusion: Insights  from the Experts.” &#160;The spirit of the panel discussion was captured best when NIH Chief  Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity Hannah Valantine, MD, said the need to enhance diversity is an opportunity to  be seized rather than a problem to be solved. </p>

<p>To seize this opportunity, we must increase  applications from individuals from underrepresented groups by communicating more  broadly and effectively about what we have to offer. &#160;Already, our staff attends national scientific  conferences to consult with and advise students and scientists at all career  levels about <a href="/careersandtraining/">research training and  career development</a>, and <a href="/grantsandfunding/">research support (grants and funding)</a>. &#160;Our other communication channels  include the “<a href="/careersandtraining/diversity/Pages/Diversity-at-NIDCR.aspx">Enhancing Diversity at  NIDCR</a>” portal and social media presence on <a href="https://twitter.com/NIDCR" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/national-institute-of-dental-and-craniofacial-research-nidcr?trk=affco" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. In  addition, potential applicants can learn about programs and resources across  NIH at the <a href="https://diversity.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NIH Office of Scientific Workforce Diversity website</a>.</p>
