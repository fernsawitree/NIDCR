<h3><strong>FNIDCR  Hosts Annual Conference and Awards</strong></h3>

<p>On  January 28 in Washington, DC, NIDCR leadership took part in the Friends of the  NIDCR (FNIDCR, <a href="http://www.fnidcr.org/" target="_blank">www.fnidcr.org</a>) Annual Conference and  Awards, which began with a congressional briefing called, “Driving Innovation  through Dental Research.” NIDCR Director Martha J. Somerman, DDS, PhD, NIDCR  Director of Extramural Research Lillian R. Shum, PhD, and NIDCR Senior  Investigator John A. Chiorini, PhD, presented at the congressional briefing to  raise awareness about how dental, oral, and craniofacial research drives  innovation. The briefing was organized by FNIDCR in collaboration with the  Congressional Oral Health Caucus, which is a bipartisan group of legislators  that supports oral health care and research and sponsors briefings and  legislative seminars. &#160;</p>

<div class="row_wrapper"><div class="right"><img src="/NewsAndFeatures/ENewsletters/CurrentNews/PublishingImages/Pamela_Robey.jpg" alt="Pamela G. Robey, PhD"/>&#160;</div>



<p>Later  in the day at the annual conference awards ceremony, FNIDCR recognized six  individuals for their contributions to improving the lives of those affected by  oral and craniofacial conditions. FNIDCR presented Pamela G. Robey, PhD, chief  of NIDCR’s Craniofacial and Skeletal Diseases Branch, with the Outstanding  NIDCR Career Research Award. Dr. Robey, who began her scientific career at NIH  nearly four decades ago, studies the activity of skeletal stem cells and their  role in skeletal diseases, and the potential application of stem cells in tissue  engineering and regenerative medicine.</p>
<p>In  the afternoon, FNIDCR presented education sessions by representatives of NIDCR,  dental schools, private industry, and patient advocacy organizations. Dr. Shum  presented, “Bringing Innovation to Market: The NIH Perspective” and NIDCR  Research Training and Career Development Branch Chief Lynn King, PhD presented,  “NIDCR Opportunities &amp; changes at NIH that align with the BMW, and  Diversity Workforce committee (BUILD, NRMN).“ &#160;</p>

  <h3><strong>Linda Watkins, PhD, to Deliver NIDCR 2015 Seymour J. Kreshover Lecture</strong></h3>
  <p>On Monday, May 4 at 2:00 pm, Linda R. Watkins, PhD, a professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Colorado at Boulder, will present the NIDCR 2015 Seymour J. Kreshover Lecture in the Lipsett Amphitheater (Building 10) on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Md. The title of her lecture is “Targeting Glia to Treat Chronic Pain: Moving from Concept to Clinical Trials.”<br/>
    <br/>
    Dr. Watkins is a University of Colorado President&#39;s Teaching Scholar and the Director of the Interdepartmental Neuroscience PhD Program.&#160;Her research is focused on&#160;how to control chronic pain and increase the effectiveness of analgesics while minimizing their side effects.&#160;She&#160;has held several research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the NIDCR, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p>
  <p>&quot;We are&#160;delighted to announce that we are reprising&#160;the NIDCR Seymour J. Kreshover Lecture after a hiatus of&#160;10 years,&quot; said NIDCR Director MJS.&#160;&quot;Dr. Watkins will deliver&#160;a powerful presentation on neuroscience that will demonstrate how our investments in basic research fuel innovations for clinical medicine.&quot; The NIDCR Seymour J. Kreshover Lecture honors the late Seymour Kreshover, DDS, MD, PhD, who served as director of the (then) National Institute of Dental Research from 1966–1975. &#160;</p>

<p>Investigators with NIH’s  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network discovered genomic differences  — with potentially important clinical implications — in head and neck cancers  caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The study is the most comprehensive  examination to date of genomic alterations in these cancers. “The rising  worldwide incidence of head and neck cancers makes these types of large  integrated genomic analyses by TCGA vital to establish a more detailed  understanding of disease causes and behavior, and for the development of new  treatment approaches,” said NIH Director Francis S.

  <p>In February, researchers  supported by the NIH Common Fund’s <a target="_blank" href="http://commonfund.nih.gov/epigenomics/index">Roadmap  Epigenomics Program</a> reported that they have mapped the epigenomes of more than 100 types of cells  and tissues, providing new insight into which parts of the genome are used to regulate  cell functions and changes in cellular activity. The epigenome is part of the  machinery that helps direct how genes are turned on and off in different types of  cells. “What the Roadmap Epigenomics Program has delivered is a way to look at  the human genome in its living, breathing nature from cell type to cell type,”  said Manolis Kellis, PhD, professor of computer science at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Cambridge, and senior author of the paper.
