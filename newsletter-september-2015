<h3>NIDCR Awards Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Grants</h3>
<p>NIDCR seeks to catalyze the preclinical and clinical development of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TE/RM) technologies for dental, oral, and craniofacial applications.  In September, NIDCR awarded R34 planning grants <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DE-15-005.html" target="_blank">(RFA-DE-15-005)</a> totaling more than $2 million for projects that will help articulate a vision, roadmap, organizational structure, and operational procedures for establishing Resource Centers. These centers will provide technical support and research capacity for a future Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Tissue Regeneration Consortium (DOCTRC). The program official for DOCTRC is Nadya Lumelsky, PhD, director of the <a href="/research/DER/IntegrativeBiologyAndInfectiousDiseases/pages/TissueEng.aspx" target="_blank">NIDCR Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Research Program</a>.</p>
