<p>Many of  the estimated 280,000 Americ​ans who have survived oral cancer treatments  contend with disabling dry mouth as a result of radiation therapy aimed at  their mouth and throat. For these oral cancer survivors, the mouth is dry because  radiation damaged the salivary glands. A dry mouth makes it challenging to talk  and eat, and makes tooth decay,  painful ulcers, and other problems in the mouth much more likely. For  some oral cancer survivors, the salivary glands may never work well again. </p>
<p>So that someday doctors  will be able to repair or regenerate salivary glands, <a href="http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/NIDCRLaboratories/CellDevelopmental/Hoffman.htm?_ga=1.51336811.391616343.1406849509">Matrix and Morphogenesis  Section Chief and Senior Investigator Matthew P. Hoffman, BDS, PhD</a>, has been identifying  the cells, signals, and other factors that are key for the gland’s development. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25805134">In a recent article in <em>Developmental Cell</em></a>, Hoffman and colleagues  are the first to describe the cellular cross talk that promotes the innervation  of the salivary gland. These findings are an important advance toward the goal  of developing treatments that restore a cancer survivor’s ability to make  saliva.</p>
<p><strong>Studying complex living tissues</strong></p>

<p>For  more than 65 years, scientists have been extracting salivary glands from mouse  embryos and observing how they grow in living tissue culture. About 12 days  after conception, a bud near the tongue forms in the embryo. This bud branches  into three or four buds, and those buds continue branching until the embryonic  gland looks like a cluster of grapes. Shortly after that, the solid cores  hollow out so the gland can release saliva through ducts into the mouth. </p>

<p>About 40  years ago, it was discovered that while the branches and cavities of the gland are  forming, nerves also develop and send out projections that weave around the  gland to innervate it. By the 13th day after conception, researchers  can separate the tiny embryonic nerves from the salivary gland (see image of  red nerves overlaying a green salivary gland). </p>
<p>“As the  salivary gland develops in the embryo, the different types of tissues are  obviously communicating with each other,” said Hoffman. Using genetically  modified mouse embryos toeavesdrop on the cross talk between the tissues, his team  is identifying what drives the precise coordination. </p>
<p><strong>Isolating progenitor cells</strong></p>
<p>“For a  cancer survivor who is unable to make much or any saliva, progenitor cells  could be isolated from the patient’s body and then transplanted inside the  diseased gland along with the factors they need to enhance or restore the  ability to make saliva,” said Hoffman. Progenitor cells are precursor cells  that have the potential to differentiate into many other cell types. Hoffman’s team is targeting a number  of cell types, including K5+ (keratin-5-positive)  progenitor cells, for  potential use in salivary gland regeneration and repair. In adults, K5+ cells  can be isolated from a patient’s skin, salivary gland, or other tissues. </p>
<p>In an embryo, the salivary gland needs a pool of K5+  cells in their precursor, undifferentiated state. If K5+ cells within the  salivary gland all differentiate into other cells, the gland doesn’t grow and  develop properly. Five years ago, Hoffman’s team published in <em>Science</em> their discovery that the nervous  tissue maintains the K5+ cells within the gland in a precursor state. If the  nerves are removed from an embryo, K5+ cells differentiate, the pool is  depleted, and gland growth is impaired.</p>
<p><strong>Discovering a  novel interaction</strong></p>

<p>“Many  researchers are looking at stem cells or progenitor cells without taking into  account nerve development and what may drive it,” said Hoffman. And yet, for  glands to work properly, nerves are as essential as the blood vessels that  supply oxygen and nutrients. </p>
<p>The experiments  described in the <em>Developmental Cell</em> article represent 6 years of work. One of the article’s co-first authors, Wendy  M. Knosp, PhD, was a postdoctoral fellow in Hoffman’s lab at the time the most  recent experiments were conducted. The project at NIDCR was a continuation of  work she began as a postdoc at the University of California San Francisco  (UCSF) in the lab of Gail R. Martin, PhD. Coincidentally, the other co-first  author, Sarah M. Knox, PhD, was a postdoctoral fellow in Hoffman’s lab at the  time of the research and is now a UCSF assistant professor and continues  investigations of gland development in her newly established lab. </p>
<p>“We already knew that  signals from the nerves keep K5+ cells as precursor cells,” said Knosp, who is now a science policy  analyst in NIDCR’s Office of Science Policy and Analysis. “But what we were surprised  to find is that K5+ cells are producing the signals required for the initiation  of innervation.” In other words, the cellular cross talk in an  embryo is bidirectional. The nerve cells help the salivary gland to develop its  branched architecture by maintaining the K5+ cells as precursor cells, and the K5+  cells within the salivary gland help the nerve cells survive and innervate the  gland.</p>

</div>
<p>Using molecular techniques and living tissue cultures  from genetically modified mouse embryos, Knosp was able to determine that the  signals coming from the K5+ cells were proteins called Wnts. “When we treated the  culture of fetal salivary glands with Wnt inhibitors, nerve development and  branching were disrupted,” said Knosp. “Normally, more than half of the nerve  cells wrap around the gland’s duct, but with the Wnt inhibitor, only about a  quarter of the nerve cells were observed around the duct.” The image below  shows the dramatic difference between normal nerve cell growth (on the left)  and its disruption after Wnt inhibition (on the right). </p>

<p>Knosp’s experiments  were confirmed using genetically modified mice that did not have nerves around  the salivary gland. By studying these mice, she discovered that the gland did  not produce the Wnt signals that drive innervation of the salivary gland. As a  result, the gland did not form properly.</p>
<p>Knosp reasoned  that what was true for salivary gland development would also be true for the  growth of other glands. Because the key signals for innervation of the pancreas  hadn’t been discovered yet, Knosp repeated the experiments with embryonic pancreases  from the same genetically modified mice. Her hypothesis was confirmed: Wnt signals  also drive innervation of the pancreas. </p>
<p>By showing  that Wnt signals are necessary for nerve development, the study provides a new  mechanism for the regulation of innervation. With the new information reported in <em>Developmental Cell</em>, researchers may be one step closer toward the  goal of developing methods of regenerating or repairing complex glands.</p>
